5,Awesome,Good ac...go for it without any second thought......can cool   12 x12 size room within 5 minutes.....
5,Worth every penny,Very good quality and fantastic cooling performance
4,Good quality product,I had purchased Blue star split inverter AC 1.2 T on dated 17 July and its installed on 19 July 2020 for my room Size 110 sqft. Its not cooling my room and it's out door unit noising like a generator. It's very high noise. My neighbors are complaining to me for this.Very disappointed to purchaee this.
4,Pretty good,"This is a wonderful ac , it really consumed less power than most of ours contemporaries. Cooling is a bit slow because probably it's Not 1.5 Tn. Bluestar guys force you to buy there stand or else pay them 400 extra as their fixing charge though it's written free installation. They have told me whenever you uninstall and reinstall this at other home (since I was in transferable job) you have to top up gas , this sounds ridiculous. So beware of these points"
4,Really Nice,Good
5,Classy product,Better than other brands... If u can afford ogeneral go for that .. otherwise this one is best for 100sq feet room. Cooling is awesome design is super... Power consumption is ok because it's a 3 star product.
5,Super!,"wesome ac, suberb cooling, cools 100x110 room within 10 mins. If its raining then dry mode works well.Installation charges are way higher than mentioned. Please read what all is covered within installation.cant really comment on energy efficiency as the bill sent is estimated during lockdown days"

5,Brilliant,Nice ac good installation
1,Useless product,Product is good but installation was worst
5,Awesome,Good cooling for a room size upto 150Sq ft. if the room is not at the top floor. Can't say about energy efficiency. If there are voltage fluctuations especially if the voltage is low then buy a non-inverter AC.
4,Value-for-money,Superb product in this price rangeBut Not as good as mitsubishi
4,Value-for-money,Product received but all of sudden Flipkart as well as Blue Star has cancelled the Installation and Demo. Very pathetic decision and totally mis management of commitment.

5,Excellent,wesome product and value for money.
4,Delightful,Product are good but installation engineer untrained. I'll suggest to choose any other options.
5,Terrific purchase,ll over good
1,Very poor,Product was good but worst installation guys. They made a big hole in wall and hole is particularly visible even after INDOOR unit installation. Also charging 200 rupee extra money from  what show in Flipkart charges. Blue star really need to look in to this to keep up their brand !!

5,Simply awesome,k
1,Utterly Disappointed,By mistake I gave you star rating otherwise  I will not  give 1 star I got this AC on 17 June but still no one come for installation and no provide any update on this. Even for installation they ask more money transportation cost and food cost. Shame on you Filipkart for planning and asking for cost very very shame
5,Terrific purchase,"very fast delivery and installation service. loved itits an indian company, so i am happy"
3,Fair,Cooling is descent but not an outstanding. A chill feel is not getting in 17/18 degree while checked. Rather a trustful brand.

3,Nice,"fter so many analysis I decided to bought this product because of brand name.First disappointment is , it's made in china product. I had a doubt, it's duplicate or not. I checked with bluestar service center and I confirmed it's a original product from bluestar and manufactured in china.If I would have know this is from China,then  I never order it.Second disappointment is, it's only suitable upto 10*10. My room size is 10*13 and it's taking more time to cool. Also, please go for 1.5 t..."
5,Great product,"I was not sure if 1.2 ton is enough for my 140 SQ. feet room. But it is more than enough. Turbo mode cools like a pro. Completely silent performance. Quick and professional installation. You can go for it without any second thought, if you have room of upto 150 sq. feet"
5,Great product,Best AC in 1.2 Ton Category. Cools my 12√ó12.5 room efficiently. Remote Quality Can be better. You have to out remote infront of AC to operate. Overall Value for Money.

4,Delightful,Purchased on June 6th. Installed within 2 days. Cooking is good. Takes few 5-10 minutes to cool the entire room of 140 sq ft. Little dissapoimted to see that in the outer cover it is written made in China.
5,Brilliant,Very good AC üëç
4,Nice product,verything good as it's Blue Star. Need to mention that extra drainage pipe and heat insulation tape came with the package. But the quality of wall mount sold by installation guys is pathetic. It got bent during installation so reduced one star.

1,Terrible product,The service men installed the AC but did not seal the holes in the wall. A lot of dust enters through the hole during storms. They charged full but did not do their work properly. Thumbs down Blue Star.
5,Worth every penny. And Cooling is awesome,C Cooling is very Nice. Almost near to 1.5 Ton and Its electricity consumption is lower than other AC.
5,Just wow!,"It's been 10 days that I have been using the product and therefore, I feel like I am in a place to give an appropriate review for the air conditioner. I am actually planning on buying a Voltas AC, but then noticed that this air conditioner has more features than any other in the market under 30k.
