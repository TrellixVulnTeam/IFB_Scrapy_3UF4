Cools my 165 sq ft room easily within 5mins that too at temp setting 24. Go for it without thinking too much. And what a superb design it is. Not like any other ACs like boxes üòú
4,Very Good,This is my 2nd AC from Godrej as the first one i brought 3 years back. The first product was good and i didn't faced any issues for which i gained confidence to buy another one.

5,Best in the market!,"Godrej is always been a favourite when it comes to cooling. I must say this time I have not been a miser and invested good amount of money just to buy godrej AC. As I have used other brands also but since I'm using godrej AC from 2 years and got satisfied with the performance, I again bought I more this time with 5 star rating and inverter ac."
