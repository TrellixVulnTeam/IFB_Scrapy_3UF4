1,Utterly Disappointed,"There is no doubt that Daikin is the one of the best AirCon in the market , but my personal experience is worst with Flipkart and the seller , AirCon is not giving cooling from the very first day . Service is not great & yes before purchase please check the seller profile . Flipkart delivery & installation team is great ."
5,Simply awesome,"elivery before scheduled Time ,good job"
5,Awesome,n the remote the temperature option in not provided remaining all awesome
5,Excellent,This AC is excellent. After use of 3 weeks I am giving this feedback. It consumes 1 unit/3 hour at 27°C when outside temperature is 38°C. It cools your room within 5 min. And Noise level is almost zero. Highly recommended this AC for those customers who wants a qualitative product with less electricity consumption.
5,Simply awesome,working efficiently with proper cooling...i am completely satisfied with performance of ac.its really good option for energy consumption.
5,Brilliant,It is a jumbo size AC. But I must say it cools very fast despite the outside the temperature being very high. The only con is the price which I think is quite high.
