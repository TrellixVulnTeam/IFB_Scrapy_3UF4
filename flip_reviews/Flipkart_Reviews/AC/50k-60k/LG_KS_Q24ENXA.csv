5,Fabulous!,Nice
1,Utterly Disappointed,Worst product I've bought so far. AC doesnt cool below 26 Degrees. Air throw is too little.
5,Awesome,C is just awesome. Use @25-26 celsius and at 40%energy saving mode and would not increase your bill muchðŸ˜„.Go for it blindly!!
5,Classy product,xcellent cooling effect and energy efficient
4,Nice product,Un happy small size
5,Fabulous!,"This AC doesnâ€™t cools like chilling winter, it creates smooth,sweet environment when turned on such a unique feature.Its silent feature is simply awesome. The AC works very silently.Loving this.Hardly room temperature comes under 23 degree. The Himalayan Cooling is very good.Flipcart services very confusing,they first told me that the installation would be free of cost.However,LG services was awesome.They were quick to resolve my issue.Installation cost was 999/-.Must buy product in..."
