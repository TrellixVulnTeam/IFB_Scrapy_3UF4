5,Terrific,It's really good.... But remote showing in description is of 2020 model not 2019 models.. Please update it.... Wrong discrimination..
5,Best in the market!,Nice
2,Moderate,Huge noise from indoor unit
1,Terrible product,"The AC works good for 2-3 days, then stops cooling. On high cooling mode it is actually throwing hot air. One can not sit in the room when this AC is on. Do not go for this product, blatant looting of consumer money."
5,Super!,"Good product but the delivery is poor i get my indoor unit first and after a long inquary i came to know that my outdoor unit is left behind in hub and after five days they deliver me the out door unit.overall the ac is good but there are some pros and cons too..

5,Must buy!,wesome ac
5,Fabulous!,Product is awesome. So cheap price. I got it 36500.and market price 43000.
4,Value-for-money,Nice
4,Value-for-money,Flipkart support- It's a value for money. I really appreciate this product. Product received in good condition. Installation was done within a week. Engineer support-Engineer support was not up to the marks. They were not fully equipped with tools. My appeal-Flipkart must take a note towards the engineering support.
5,Terrific,"Got it for 37k, a installation charge was 999 which i pretty much okay. AC was up to my expectation. A good deal i would say. Just go for it, don't think even twice."
5,Super!,Good for your pocket
4,Good quality product,"It is good, it will cool down after running long time."
5,Best 10/10,Flipkard is best option for purchasing productThanks Flipkard
4,Wonderful,installation was very fast and good... paid 1300 for it....but ac cooling is less as compared to my panasonic ac 1.5 ton...i think lg has focused more on power saving rather than cooling
4,Really Nice,Product quantity is good... nothing fancy...works ok....filter is in the top... service charges will be higher than other brands but support quality is good and seriously taken
5,Excellent,Cooling down day by day
5,Excellent,mazing product ...if your budget something 40k then must buy
5,Best in the market!,very fast shipping and delivery . noice level very low . installation cost very reasonable . i m pay 1800 for installation . my room size 100 sq feet . very fast cooling .
5,Classy product,I love itI bought the LG dual inverter model Q18ENZA ..1.5 ton 5star from flipcart. This is a very good product.its cooling is very good.its fascinating to see.
5,Highly recommended,This AC is very best cooling
5,Great product,"Perfect. No regrets, used for a month now. Runs for around 16 hrs in a day and only 4-5  units extra for ac. Satisfied."
5,Just wow!,Good
5,Value for Money!,"Brilliant quality product with elegant design, features and advanced technology."
5,Brilliant,"Superb Product but it doesn't have horizontal swing, although remote has a button to toggle the swing but its not supported by this model.Rest the AC is very good and a satisfactory product at this price point."
4,Good quality product,Better choose 3/4 inveter.&.. 2020 model.....& flipkart play his game.i.e.1st day give 2000/- discount next day ...nt appiar......overall gd one....and gd servies...
4,Very Good,Writing this review after use of 2 weeks. This AC is nice.. working perfectly in my room around 200 sqft. Cooling wise good. Design is too simple.. single color unit. No noise observed. Very nice product.. value for money. I bought it for Rs 37000 from flipkart.
4,Pretty good,awsome product....üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
1,Very poor,Slow cooling
5,Fabulous!,xcellent Product got at 35.5k. Outdoor unit is making little bit more noise.
5,Fabulous!,Great
5,Simply awesome,excellent ac
5,Worth every penny,mazing product
4,Wonderful,No vertical fin movement. If your budget is a bit tight and you want a 5 star and 1.5T then go for it.
5,Terrific,mazing product....value for money!!!
1,Don't waste your money,"Just after 2 days of installation, AC stopped cooling and flashing error - CH38. And now LG technichian who visited after complaints stated that it's not installed properly and all Gas of this AC has leaked. Also persons who installed AC from LG he told were untrained therefore during these 2 days all Gas of AC leaked. Why should customer suffer due to untrained installation?"
5,Excellent,Nice
5,Terrific,Its been a great experience with Flipkart and LG team. Performance of the ac is just superb. Thanks.
5,Fabulous!,"1.5 ton is far better even for a bigger room also, like mine is 2400 sq ft and till now working fine.....but yes as far as efficiency goes it takes long time to cool and to become stagnant after long tym which is much important for energy consumption(which is little high)..."
5,Wonderful,Go for it
5,Highly recommended,Need to change installation policy...other ac is the best
5,Simply awesome,"Good experience, good product. Installation guys mislead and overcharge.... One needs to be careful of them"
5,Brilliant,Good
5,Classy product,Nice product
4,Delightful,Its overall good... I'm just not satisfied with service and installation.
5,Perfect product!,Good deal
5,Super cooling AC,"Super cooling AC, its cool very fast in 5 min,, i am using from last 1 month , i found best AC at this price with super LG brand."
4,Delightful,Nice product
1,Terrible product,c cooling capacity not good. Fan speed is very low in high mode also. Design is good but performance is not well. Please do not buy it . Voltas ac are best in split ac category . Please buy Voltas instead of lg.
5,Highly recommended,realy a superb AC u anjoy a rock cooling
3,Fair,The product delivery was prompt. Great job by Flipkart. But the installation procedure was not upto the mark. The men who came for installation were novice without proper tools. Their knowledge about the product demo was also very limited. Very unprofessional approach from LG.
5,Must buy!,verall its good machine from LG. It cools comfortably on HC mode. Highly recommended
4,Value-for-money,Very nice in energy efficiency. Consumes only 2.5 to 3 units for a 8 hour run.design is good. Horizontal swing doesn't works. There is manual lever to move the fins horizontally. The installation guys were not very professional and were only interested in selling me the stand. But product is very good. If you want lower electricity bill then go for it without any second thought.
5,Great product,Great product and less power consumption. If you use in right way. But flipkart no cost EMI policy is not good at last we have to pay the full amount of product. It's a trap.
4,Delightful,"Not an expert on AC, but gets its job done in silent manner. Remote should have back light and/ or buttons should have redium. Sleep mode sometimes feels like Ac is not working and switched off."
5,Good Product But dont Trust Flipkart Call in Customer Servic,The product is good....Guess the only downside will be there is no option to swing for left right direction and filter placement is good for me and is easy to clean....Good installation by Mr.Senthil and team. Flipkart Customer service is pathetic because of Poor Knowledge transfer had to call them three times just to get clarity on the Installation Charges as there was an offer going on. Frustated with their Response.
5,Worth every penny,Nice AC...low noise...good buy...value for money...

5,Mind-blowing purchase,Best product in this range
5,Wonderful,Great product and service by LG.
3,Nice,"Got this at a very good offer 32k + no cost Emi. Performing well so far. outer there was little damage in the lining. Guys came for fitting said it won't be an issue. hopefully, that's true. 2019 vs 2020 only difference is sideways swing is not there in 2019. Not sure how much of difference that makes(I don't feel its that important)"
5,Best in the market!,"Good AC,  effective cooling"
5,Must buy!,The best AC in 1.5 tons.. very good efficiency.. just 2 hours function enough after that we can keep sleep mode.. 9 hours running only 2 to 3 units consumption
5,Terrific purchase,I've been using it for a month now & I've no complaints yet.Delivery & installation was smooth & as scheduled.
5,Just wow!,effiecient cooling with lesser noise although at himalayan cool mode noise is bit higher but can be ignored for the ac at this price range. Delivery of the product was bit late but Installation done on same day. Overall satisfied with the product. value for money.
5,Just wow!,c is good at this price & cooling too is good. The only drawback is that its bit noisy.
5,Awesome,xcellent product.Delivered before due date by flipcart.Installation done within time.
5,Perfect product!,Supar prodect
5,Classy product,"verall decent value for money and based on couple of months usage energy efficient as well. The vanes do not move left to right, only up and down.  and not sure of its voltage input range as well and hence invested in a decent stabiliser. The installation will cost 3000 rs given all the chargeable components , so do not expect it to come cheap. Overall decent value for money as I got ac + stabiliser + installation at rs 42 k."
5,Excellent,Nice job flipkart..So fast delievery.Thanks
4,Pretty good,Product is good but Installation experience was very bad they have charged extra Rs. 237/- for just fixing outdoor unit stand in wall. Installation executives were also seemed inexperienced while installing indoor unit they made a very big hole in the wall.
3,Decent product,installation service is poor otherwise product is value for money

5,Perfect product!,eview after 20 days use : Highly satisfied with the delivery as well as installation process!

No complaints so far. I've a room of 10X12 and within 30 mins, it reaches the set temperature. Also the energy control feature is excellent.

4,Good choice,"LG Dual Inverter Split ACHave been using it since past 20 days.Bought it in the electronics sale due to which I got an extra 2000rupees discount. Installation Charges: 1000 Rupees + 750 for wall mount stand.The installation people are not very professional,They came in the evening and were in a hurry to install the product.I would recommend to book the installation in the morning time and be very particular at the time of installation.Now talking about the product-If anyone want a 1...."

1,Useless product,Very bad experience for lg.. Late installation and no gas on Ac after installation.. Vertical swing not working only horizontal swing is working.. Vertical swing adjust manually not working with remote
5,Super!,c was great cooling was great value for money in this price no 1 gives u this kind of product. Lg is very reputated brand and bought it in only 33k great deal just go for it..and tha guy came to install the ac was also very kind experienced and co-operative with any second doubt just go for it
5,Wonderful,Nice cooling
5,Awesome,Still not installed after almost 1week of product delivery otherwise I love Lg products.Installation was done and I am very happy with my product. Go for it.
3,Nice,verall the ac is quite good. But lg should focus more on its installation team. It was horrible experience with them. They were rude and also didn't help in cleaning the mess they created. Two stars reduce for it only.Overall the product is good considering the price but horizontal swing is missing. Will give review after the first month electricity bills
5,Fabulous!,"Thanks flipkart for great offers ans huge discount aloa thanks LG once againt awesome product, fast and easy cooling."

5,Terrific,"wesome AC, I use it at 40% energy between 27-28 degrees during night and around 28-29 degrees during daytime, it cools perfectly fine. Silent operation and good set of features especially hoping energy control reduces the bills.Decent looks.Installation is by LG and in Delhi it was a pleasent experience. Only extra charge was for installation of stand as I already purchased one.Hoping for hassle free operations in future."
5,Worth every penny,Best in this price segment
5,Simply awesome,"Nice AC, got for decent price of 38k. Paid 1800 for installation which included stand cost. Prompt service. AC was delivered on one day afternoon and next early morning LG installed. Happy with overall product and service delivery experience."

5,Terrific purchase,xcellent
5,Super!,Cost effective and efficient product. Installation was within next day of delivery.
5,Super!,I am writing this review after 1 week usage.AC is working fine. Actually my room is on first floor and area is 240 sq ft so its Himalayan Cool feature takes half an hour to bring down temperature from 38 to 24 degree which is comfortable. But HC feature draws more power.Delivery on 3rd day and next day installation.Thankyou Flipkart and LGOverall I am satisfied with the product.
5,Just wow!,fter 4 days of usage it was worth product and silent machine.
5,Best in the market!,Well it's been just 1 month... But my experience is good with this AC. Cooling is up to the mark and energy efficiency is very nice and stands out.
5,Must buy!,"ne of best product by LG. Noise level is very low. Faster cooling. Good looking. Energy consumption is negotiable. But flipkart service is very poor. Fast delivery but after delivery flipkart takes no responsibility to initiate installation.With this i also order a stabilizer but flipkart change my ordered model without any pre notification. When i contact to flipkart they all blames are move to the seller, and they shows no responsibility. It is very unpredictable to me."
1,Terrible product,"Cooling is Very Very Poor..not up to tha Standard, I have another Daikin and Hitachi Acs both are better...I would suggest only Buy General OR Daikin OR Hitachi..no other AC gives required cooling"
5,Worth every penny,wesome Ac. Cooling and energy saving feature is too good only one thing is bad that is Horizontal swing ( Left right movement) is not working in this Ac.
5,Mind-blowing purchase,wesome product.value for money.
5,Best in the market!,"xvellent cooling, low noise and premium look! Neat installation is cherry on cake!"

1,Terrible product,Ghatia product
5,Mind-blowing purchase,This AC is much better than Voltas. There is very less noise compared to voltas and also it feels premium product with its build quality. Within 10min it cools my 170sqft room.Must buy product. I got it for 34000. 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter AC
5,Just wow!,wsome product at such price. Thanx flipkart for providing at a cheaper price than local market and even same day installation. Good work... Satisfied üòä
4,Worth the money and satisfactory delivery from flipkart,"I am using this for around 4 days, So far experience is good, cools down the room quickly. Delivery was quick and installation guy was also upto the mark. Thanks flipkart for taking care of the hardest part and deliver us a good product with your stamp.Thanks,Sumanta"
4,Very Good,"Installation is messed up. LG engineers are not willing to do anything. They want every thing done (from power arrangement to making whole in ceiling) and just charging money for hanging your AC and putting pipe. I think they should be more holistically trained and more commitment needed to shower from their side in the process. If this happens with you too, my strong suggestion goes to go for local electrician insted of getting yourself screwed up. Otherwise, AC works fine."
5,Excellent,Same day installation compete. Very fast delivery.
4,Good choice,Good one but need to check the power control mode after that will give feedback
1,Worthless,The cooling of a air conditioner is awesome if I put it on 24 degree centigrade so you feel you come into Antarctica in night I put Air conditioner on 26'C so I rate 5star in coolingCooling:5starInstallation:1starInstallation is so bad Flipkart doesn't provide us installation I called Flipkart 100 times but they doesn't sent Authorized engineer so in the end they tell me you have install it by my own so I install it to L.G authorized engineerSeller is so bad
