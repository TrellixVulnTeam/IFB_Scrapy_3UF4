5,Terrific,This is the first time I ordered electronic product in any online format with lots of doubt but after receiving it I was surprised to see the product with Super packing like buying products in offline...  So what are you waiting and why are you wasting you money to buy with heavy price on offline...  Go for it as Bluestar is always Bluestar.

4,Worth the money,elivery was amazing and got the product within 3 days.. But... Installation guys come with 4 kids and there were hovering around my house in this pandemic situation.. i strictly as them to go outside also the charge supposed to be 750/- but he took 1000/- for installation (excluding wiring and stabilizer).... Over-all the Ac works as expected also cooling is great bluestar is known for its cooling....
