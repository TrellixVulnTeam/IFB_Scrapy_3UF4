5,Wonderful,"wesome product, satisfied with Havells India & Lloyd for their product.Flipkart delivery can be more professional where product reaches intact, could see minor scratches on packaging."
1,Installation not done and waiting and calling Mr Salman,"Installation not done, message received that Mr Salman coming for installation bit no response, calling again and again... Very poor response..... Not happy..... Why customer would suffer...... I need immediate solution and take back your product..... I bought for summer purpose..... Of my purpose is defeated than what is the use..."
4,Really Nice,I got this at Rs.32200/- I am very happy for this and installation change is very high and please select proper installation agency
5,Great product,Super but delivery person was very rude ...
1,Absolute rubbish!,"Never buy any product on Flipkart they are not in control of anything and all promises done are like Indian politicians promises they will be with words never get acted upon, flipkart is worse than that"
5,Great product,Cooling capacity is good. Using it for more than one month. Working as desired. Installation service is average. Technician who has installed the AC is not better than any nearby local technician. They did not brought the extra drainage pipe. They did not given any instructions for product usage. Even they do not have  core cutting tools. Flipkart should consider changing their installation partner.
5,Just wow!,Good to buy.
4,Good quality product,Genuine feedback :Recently purchased.. Using it from past one week..met my expectations..I think it takes 5 min to feel cooling. Indoor unit design is ok and less noise Regarding options in remote are few.. compared to toshiba and other brands.Compressor/ outdoor unut quite big &  makes less noise.Installation from Jeeves (flipkart partner)was ok but installation charges are more 1599 (standard installation) + extra power cable 1 meter/100 rs + if u need power socket (16 amps) charged 75 ...
4,Value-for-money,Purchased @ 37999/- installed on 7 th June 2020. Performance is. Very good indoor size is reasonably smal size and effective cooling. Filter cleaning is very easy to remove clean and replace.
5,Mind-blowing purchase,Good AC. Nice cooling.
2,Expected a better product,Flipkart service was excellent  but third party installation was pathetic.
5,Mind-blowing purchase,Nice cooling Less noisy And most important ‚ÄòMade in India‚Äô
