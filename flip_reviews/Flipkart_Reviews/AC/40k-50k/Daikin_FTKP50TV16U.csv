5,Mind-blowing purchase,xcellent and Fast Cooling. Great Product by Daikin
5,Classy product,"uring this pandemic situation i got the product delivered on time. However the packing of internal unit was open. Installing was done on time and they did a good job. But there is another catch with daikin.They don't give you drain pipe and electric wire. So I would advise to get drain pipe,  electric wire and 16 amp plug before the installation because installation guy overcharge and that is what has been done to me and that's the only place where i am disappointed."
