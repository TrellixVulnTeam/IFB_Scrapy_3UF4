5,Must buy!,Its good product at resonable price thanks to Flipkart
5,Terrific purchase,I've been taking service of Mr. LG Fully Automatic Washing Machine for last three years and he never made us disappointment! He is a hard worker yet so silent. We need his service of regular wash every third day for our family consist of four and never escalated our water and electricity bills. No complaints still  with our 6.2 model and hence bought another one (6.5 kg) for my parents last week. Thanks flipkart for the timely delivery and installation.
5,Just wow!,Very nice washing machine
4,Good choice,couple of features are missing.
5,Just wow!,wesome product
5,Mind-blowing purchase,easy 2 use n Helpfull
1,Utterly Disappointed Don't Go for it,I am giving 1 Rating because there is no indication of how much liquid / surf we have to pour and all the surf is loading into cloths at a time. This will damage the top most cloths. After washing is completed my top most cloth is still contains surf. I have to wash it manually for removing surf in that cloth.
5,Simply awesome,"wesome product, thank you Flipkart"
5,Perfect product!,Product is super cool... Delivery also very good.

2,Moderate,"ake no mistake, this is probably the cheapest and barebone entry level automatic washing machine. There is no air dry, no special features, the door doesnt have smart lock, there is no childlock. Very bare minimal programmes, very less options for self programming. There is no inlet for bleach etc, no seaprate compartment for additives like fabric cleaner. Overall it gets the work done. This model is atleast 2 to 3 yrs or more outdated and not a good buy for 2020. You will get much better op..."
4,Nice product,"Pros Product is good.Less noise. Delivery is good. Cons: If power cut happens and resumes, machine starts program from beginning. Don't belive in Exchange policy of flipkart. Rejecting for dent, rust. No value for old product here but here they are providing false promises in old product price. No old product is exchanged here, so while buying don't include exchange price in this payable price."

5,Must buy!,"Super intilgent machine.it is great machine with less buttons which is way convenient for elders or starters who will be easy to use.Just press power button and start button,rest machine is calculating load and it is automatically setting time needed and water needed to finish the wash. Wash quality is good and dry output is around 70%."
