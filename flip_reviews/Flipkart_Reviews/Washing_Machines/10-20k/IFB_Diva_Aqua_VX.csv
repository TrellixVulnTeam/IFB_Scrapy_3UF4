1,Don't waste your money,Flipkart is not take credibility to assure to get product in shown offer in its website.so do not belive on Flipkart by closing your eye as it say filpkart assured.i am worried till I get my product in offer price.wasted lots time and money. So be careful while shoping on flipkart.after placing order only seller and delivery agency deciced that you get product or not.Flipkart don't take any action for customer benifit.

5,Wonderful,"I have used this machine for one week only. Please evaluate my review accordingly.In order to verify the power consumption, I had installed an energy meter & observed the followings,Cotton wash mode, cold wash used 0.15 unit electricity for a wash and warm wash used 0.35 unit. Didn't check Hot wash. It is 0.8 unit According to installer. Could be true from above experience.

1,Absolute rubbish!,"Washing quality is very very poor even after a program cycle of 2hrs. Return policy period is too low, because effectively you get only 8 days to return. No tray for blue and comfort, providing these trays is not at all cost effective for manufacturer. IFB lost its reputation. My uncle's Samsung top load is far better than this IFB front load. My mother and wife are very disappointed and they started using our old LG semi automatic washing machine. Don't buy this thinking that it's an ever lo..."

5,Best in the market!,Super product very good delivery
5,Best in the market!,"Great balance of price, performance, features, quality, and design. Was looking for something that was not too expensive, but didn't want to buy something that wouldn't adequately meet our needs. This machine fits the bill perfectly. Capacity-wise it is a bit smaller than I was expecting, but that's not really an issue. We typically do a load every 2-3 days and that's 2-3 people each load. So not too bad. Would definitely recommend."
3,Does the job,o not go for exchange in flipkart. They will give some reasons and will not take your old machine. Otherwise its OK. Ifb is the best in all models. Previous ifb machine I have used from 2005.
4,Really Nice,I bought it in June 2020 . Till now.. only problem is it's lighting display of start and stop button. Otherwise good performance.

3,Nice,Product is ok but while installation they are charging too much amount for stand and filter(4500/-) while the machine cost is 19000.They are simply warning about cancellation of warranty if reject to buy those accessories
5,Brilliant,Good

3,Fair,It's ok.... Not bad
4,Really Nice,"Using front load machine 1st time so this is my personal review. Machine is more or less soothing sounded. Performs well. Washes well. Drys average. Operating process easy. Assured brand. Assured service I think, whatever using it for just 7 days only.Some points to improve this product:Accessories like inlet pipe and extention fauchet is not delivered with machine. So either you have to find and buy from market seperately or from the demo person surprisingly.Outlet pipe is shorter than ..."
5,Highly recommended,Best brand.... That too made in india
3,Fair,"s far as washing quality is concerned, it is scores full marks but the biggest drawback is that it doesn't wash one or two jeans or bedsheets. If you wash one double bedsheet it would show load disbalance error. It is so irritating that you need atleast 3 three bedsheets to complete the wash successfully. Overall I am not satisfied."

5,Best in the market!,"No complaints, very solid product"
4,Worth the money,Product is good but installation process becomes irritated since there is no proper staff is available
5,Terrific purchase,The volume is very high  but the clothes are washing good
5,Best in the market!,"5* for flipkart on-time delivery and installation communications. Haven't used the machine much yet, but it's 5* based on current impression. May update the review in future. However, the installation people asked to get the necessary plumbing done separately, and they would demo after that. It would be a much more seamless experience if the installation team can provide an option to get plumbing done as well (for an extra charge perhaps)."
4,Wonderful,"Nice product... but still need to consider few points Complete dry option is not availableCompare to other brands it takes a little extra time for washing and accesories like stand, liquid etc cost a bit high... Rest all fine"
5,Highly recommended,Best product and at less price ..
4,Good choice,wesome performance.. accessoires are high cost compare to other brands
2,Could be way better,"I purchased this machine on 22 Jun 2020 and started using by 29 Jun 2020. Delivery was prompt and ifb installation happened with in 48hrs of delivery. I have purchased this in an offer where I exchanged my 11 years old machine of IFB 5.5Kg Serena model. . But biggest issue which I identified when the ifb installation engineer came to my home when compared to my old machine. These is no separate section in the detergent tray for adding additives like Ujala, comfort fabric etc. But it was avail..."
2,Moderate,"Its my initial review comments on this product,1. first thing i noted that the product out pipe is very short compared to my old washing machine, I could able to reach to sink hole my bathroom which is just 1 feet away from the washing machine place. IFB need give at least 2.5 out let pipe drain pipe for the equipment.2. This new washing machine need to be used only on the liquid detergent and should not use the detergent powder. when the product is designed this should have taken care , i ..."

2,Not good,Sound of the machine is so high and no alarm not so good and ho high vibration
4,Very Good,"Waited 9 days for installation from local ifb guys in Pune and they left with only unpacking the washing machine. No water line hook up, no electrical hook up,  no plumbing, no nothing. Had to get a plumber cause and it ended costing another 4k for these things. I have given up on online buying for expensive stuff. I would go local and get things done on the same day and not wait for flipkart or ifb to come and rescue..."
5,Fabulous!,Very Good performanceDilevary & Installation are fast and satisfied
5,Simply awesome,Good product value of money
4,Wonderful,IFB stand was sold for Rs.1660 and IFB cover was sold for Rs.660 while installation and demo. This is almost double of other similar accessories.
5,Brilliant,Very good
4,Really Nice,Installation will take long time
1,Did not meet expectations,"Installation demo was not good, the executive forced to purchase unnecessary items Cover, stabilizer, extra fitting, washing machine cleaning powder, clothes detergent. Demo given within 5 to 10 minutes and hurried to complete the demo. First time machine taken 2 hours then after got error message, so we called executive and local company there is no response from their end. Waste of money for machine and extra items stand, cleaning powder, fittings. There is no support."
