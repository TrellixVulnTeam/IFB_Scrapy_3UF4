5,Wonderful,Good Delivery by Flipkart. Machine is brand new and no dents
4,Value-for-money,Great Product n Nice Performance
5,Perfect product!,Its a heavy machine and quiet silent. Nice automated modes. No function to change heating capacity. Rest all rpm and timer can be set as per minimum predefined sets. You need to have a washing machine inlet pipe as one provided is very short. You can purchase pipe from the installer else get it from hardware store at little lesser price. Happy with the product. *If you have a small tap you want to use with go for inlet connector type 2 that can be fitted on the tap.*
