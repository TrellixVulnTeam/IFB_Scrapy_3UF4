1,Hated it!,Installation is a huge issue for this machine. Got it week back and still it's kept uninstalled. It requires a specific adaptor which you won't get anywhere in market . The machine won't come with that adaptor. Now you are left with only option that is to order it and still that's uncertain that it will fit properly. Installation is a disappointment for this machine.
4,Wonderful,"In one word, I can define it as BEAST. It does its job very well. Just go for it (if you are looking for a quality product instead of budget) if you have a good water pressure, in my case, I have a normal water pressure on top floor of my 2 storey house, might be it requires more than what I have as a low water pressure indicator is always on. But the good thing is that this works as expected even in low water pressure. In future I will raise the overhead tank height, probably that will solve..."
5,Terrific,"Worth buying this machine, superb performance so far."
5,Just wow!,5 Star to Flipkart for Delivery and Installation Facilitation. The Bosch engineer was very friendly and explained all the features very well. Only took the tap attachment for the machine from him for 300 bucks. Did not try to sell anything else. Overall very happy with the purchase. The machine performs as advertised. Very silent and efficient.

4,Delightful,"I did a lot of research on different washing machines from all companies out there(the only 2 last standing were samsung and this bosch washing machine).I ordered this washing machine during lockdown period. There were some difficulties with the installation such as the person getting late or telling it late that there are some things that need to be installed on customer end, plus I also had to schedule installation again all on my own.It has almost been a month of using this machine and..."

5,Excellent,We received order within 3 dayThanks for flipkart
4,Worth the money,"I purchased this product in flipkart in June 28th, 2020. The product delivered on 1st july and got it installed by Bosch technician on 4th July. The machine is very good and functioning nicely. So far verified 4 to 5 modes and all are working fine. However observed slight vibration/ shaking during spinning . This has to be Checked and observed further whether levelling problem of four legs or machine problem. Overall performance is good and recommended."
4,Worth the money,"Got this machine on 1st Jul 2020. So far so good. But there is one problem with this machine, it doesn't have a buzzer. If water supply is not on- no buzzer, when program is finished- no buzzer. I was using LG which has a very good buzzer to indicate issue or complete process"
5,Best in the market!,"Worth for money. It's really nice ,good, works"
5,Terrific purchase,Value for money and it works very fast and if we remove clothes from the washing machine we can easily wear it!! Because it gives us 75%dry clothes and it really very very very good
5,Great product,"Very much satisfied with this product.All type of features are available and very good build quality. Machine running is very smooth and noiseless. Product delivered within 3 days from the order date and installation took 1 week may be delayed due to COVID-19 situation. Very happy with the product, thanks Bosch. Delivered the expectations"
5,Just wow!,Value for money.... Very less noise.
3,Good,"eceived product as promised on time and we still not switched it on yet, so can't comment on performance. One thing that puzzled or disappointed me is that, the installation engineer said this machine doesn't have an inverter however product title says ""Inverter ExpressWash Fully Automatic"" bizzare!!! Don't know who is right here flipkart or the engineer. If flipkart did it so, this is not good for the business to sell products with false titles. If the engineer is wrong, would let Bosch..."
5,Must buy!,xcellent product.
4,Wonderful,elivery is on time and installation and demo completed well before scheduled time. Product is  nice and value for money.
5,Great product,achine is working very well. No installation and demo at all.That person just called me and said you have to install the machine on your own.
4,Really Nice,xcellent product
4,Nice product,achine working fine
5,Worth every penny,Bosch is the best
4,Wonderful,"elivery was perfect , demo was very worst they are not professional their requirement to operate the machine threaten the user and what is their recommendation is against the design."
4,Delightful,Initial setup and accessories provided were very bad. Given water inlet pipe provided by Bosch is very short and doesn't fit to any regular taps. Neither the service man brought an adaptor for that pipe. I have to buy another water inlet pipe of 1.5mts. I'm checking in Visakhapatnam since a month and didn't get an adaptor for inlet pipe.The power cord is also very short.
5,Classy product,"Flipkart delivered it promptly. The delivery guys were very helpful in exchanging my old machine.This machine requires 15amp electrical point. Do not keep it in the bathroom.The machine is very good, washes clothes very clean, and has good heating washing capacity.Must buy for all households."
