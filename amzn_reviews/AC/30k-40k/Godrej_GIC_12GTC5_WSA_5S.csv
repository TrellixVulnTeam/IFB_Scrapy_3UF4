5,05-Jul-20,Useless products of Godrej,good
5,30-Jun-20,Ac,AC is pretty good. Very quiet operation. And effective as well.
5,23-Jun-20,good,"Product was delivered within one day in prime, installation done same day, absolutely no complain, working nice. Value for money."
4,20-Jun-20,very quiet,This is very efficient AC for 10X14ft room though noises level could be less. Not very efficient on energy.Air flow is very strong in swing path and could be improved for distribution.Good value for money and good after sales service.Amazon delivery experience is as always good and timely.
1,13-Jun-20,Godreg 1 ton Ac,Very Poor Customer care support. Don't buy the Godrej product. IF you call to customer support. they don't have any kind of information like authorize service center or their technician for installation. You need to keep waiting keep waiting untill unless the Godrej technician will call & I don't think will it HappenFor Amazon: When I purchased the item that time it price was 31990 but after Delivered the item Price goes down to 30990 what is this?
5,11-Jun-20,"Good, value for money",Superb!
4,10-Jun-20,Poor Service By Godrej,Dimensions shown of inner unit are different from Godrej Site. Check before buying
1,06-Jun-20,Superb AC,"Early to give feedback for ac as got it 3 days back but installation service by godrej is pathetic, guy lied about extra copper wire use and took money (3000extra). As some problem was there, another guy came next day from godrej, he admits being charged extra by first guy. This is what we get from authentic godrej installation service, no honesty. You need to keep an eye on them while installation, they are not professionals at all. Be careful."
5,06-Jun-20,Product good but installation big problem,"This AC is one best in its range.The cooling is awesome for this ACAlso, The noise level is also quite low."
