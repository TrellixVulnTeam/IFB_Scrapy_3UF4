1,07-Jun-20,Awesome Air-conditioners from LG,We have 2 bedrooms. we already has one old lg Ac for one bedroom. So we bought the new one for other room. About the new one Cooler is better than this. My old lg Ac is working very nice even though it is 5 years old. But the knew one is  the worst not at all cooling the room even after half an hour cooling at 16 the room temp got down from 31 to 29 only. Trying to contact them but no response as it is lockdown. I will change my review when they do their service and make the ac work properly.
