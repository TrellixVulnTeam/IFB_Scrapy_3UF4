3,08-Aug-20,Best REMOTE ever 👌🏻👌🏻,AC Remote is giving a lot of trouble. Doesn't work properly.Need to press the button 5 to 10 times for it to work. Repaired by customer service but still the problem is persistent.
1,08-Aug-20,Installation issues,"Daikin denied installation service saying the room was too large for 1.5 ton A/C but also refused to state what is the max square foot for this. They said, 'recommended 150 sq foot' but even that is not mentioned in the product specs. Product was returned. Amazon has refunded the money."
3,30-Jul-20,Not satisfactory,This is how it sounds after almost a year of use and as per service engineer this is a normal sound for all inverter Air conditioners and they even do not require any customer satisfaction report for closure of the complaint.
1,29-Jul-20,Can be installed only in <150 sq ft,This has been one of the worst ACs we have purchased from Daikin. We had 2 daikin ACs and had purchased this in November 2019. In just the last 9 months We have faced gas leakage issues twice from the indoor unit. I would not recommend buying this particulate model.
5,17-Jul-20,Poor product,Good
5,16-Jul-20,Don’t Buy,"We have observed that Fantastic product. Cooling is very good. Power-chill effect is good. No noise function is great but installation charge is too high as like extra copper wire, core cutting charges."
4,13-Jul-20,Excellent,Medium
5,11-Jul-20,Awesome product,Excellent performance. Installation was bit delayed due to pandemic.
4,10-Jul-20,Please my order bill,Nice
5,08-Jul-20,Dainik 4 Star inverter AC,Awseme cooling
4,05-Jul-20,Best REMOTE ever 👌🏻👌🏻,"It is good that I gave second chance to purchasing AC from amazon in recent time. My earlier experience was horrible due to product issue (different make) and then slower response from Amazon. However Amazon returned the money but i still lost money spent on installation. Anyways, still because of multiple good experience in past, I bought Daikin AC and from product to installation every thing was perfectly done. Amazon delivered it a day later than promised but the installation was quick and done very professionally. They cleared our doubts regarding the installation and even managed to use the holes of previous AC. The product is aesthetically appealing and is working perfectly since installation. Good that I gave a second chance."
1,01-Jul-20,Installation issues,"I have purchase 28/05/20 .my unite is not make cooling, 2 time visit by Daikin engineer.I have sended 5-6 email but no reply, Daikin unit consume approx 1100-1200 unit of my electrical bill in last 30 days.i will not use my Daikin AC if they not change, i will dismantle my unt and will send to daikin head office and will go to consumer Court.I want to new unit form Daikin, i am copy pasting my last communication email.Dear Prabhat jiI am not satisfy with My daikin AC, after refilling the gas in compressor ac is not working,when after gas refill in the compressor ac temperature set on 24 degree cooling mode temperature is not going blor 18.5 near blowing fan pic attached.I want to replace my product without being late and don't want any other service visit, because daikin gives me faulty products.  My product is only 30 day old.I have been facing problems from the beginning and My daikin product is not working well. My parents are 68 year old. My daikin AC has been consuming more power since I purchased it.  I have found  approx 1000 unt from 10/06/20 till today.My common electrical bill is approx 2700/Rs to 3000/Rs with one AC running hour Approx 18-19 hour, I can show my previous bills if you want.At 24 degrees When Daikin AC starts  taking 8.1 AMP  and after running not going below 5.5 AMP, I think that is not good for my Electric Bill.I have attached an invoice, temperature pic, Service engineer report and my another AC temperature pic.I need the solution ASAP, Kind take necessary Action.Best regardsRajesh Kumar"
3,30-Jun-20,It good to give second chance. Excellent product!!,"Made a big mistake while selecting Inverter option in AC.With desired temperature of 25 degree in cool mode, this Inverter AC takes big load, about 2KW, while beginning but gives lesser cooling power than non inverter ACs, and takes more time, about 45 mins to 60mins to cool the room of size 150 sq ft.It never switches off the compressor (by virtue of its name ""Inverter"") and it takes minimum of 1.2 to 1.6KW and if you keep on running it for about 3-4 hours then the load gets reduced to 0.9 to 1.2KW, which is still very very high. So one can imagine the electricity bill and compare this with normal AC (which will take full load of 1.8-2.0KW for 60-90 mins max in 3-4 hours.So over-all, if someone needs to run AC for about 10hrs max (so over-night), do not buy this.Buy inverter only when you have to run all day ... more than 15-16 hours, else it will make deep cut in your pocket.Will add more updates, later after using it post 1 month of usage"
4,29-Jun-20,wast of money (name bade per darsan chote),"installation by local service agent not satisfactory..no proper tools with them to bend the copper pipes .hope daikan gives service agency to good professionals. charged Rs.200 for wires ,Rs 300.00 for fixing outdoor stand( material not included) apart from standard installation charges"
1,23-Jun-20,Even Lower Star Non Inverter AC is more efficient than this 4 Star Inverter AC,Very poor management by Amazon. Amazon doing bullsit non sence activities. Customer always fight to install all ways time
5,22-Jun-20,poor service in my location,"Awesome product,dont think just go for it.installation service from daikin was good.i think best product in this segment."
5,19-Jun-20,Wrong,"So efficient, silent, best performance even at 27°C with fan switched off, pleasent cooling for hours, both night & day times."
5,14-Jun-20,"Dont think of price,its value for money kind of product","Installed last Saturday, cooling efficiency is nice, good product from Daikin."
4,13-Jun-20,Best domestic a/c,Everything was fine..given only four star due to no display in indoor unit
4,13-Jun-20,"Good Product, liked it.",Good product at this price range
1,10-Jun-20,Best REMOTE ever 👌🏻👌🏻,remote is not working
4,10-Jun-20,Installation issues,"Received product after multiple followups we have to wait 2 3 days post commitment, drainage pipe was also missing we had purchased from installation guy... product performance is quiet good..Remote is also of different design and remote stand is also missing"
1,06-Jun-20,remote not working,Don’t buy this product. Delivered ac was faulty. Its internal pcb unit was malfunctioning and ac was not able to power on. Still charged half the fees for installation.Daikin service network is really poor. Not sure if its because of lockdown. No one answers phone calls. Its been 7 days and till now Daikin is not able to solve the problem.
5,04-Jun-20,Product is good but poor delivery by DELHIVERY,One problem is that water overflows from the indoor unit. This has to be cleaned regularly say once in two months.This has to be resolved by Daikin.
4,04-Jun-20,Worst purchase ever from Amazon,AC was good. But installation by Zeva team was hot proper. AC technician did not check the leak test. They came without sanitizer & gloves.
3,04-Jun-20,Water overflows - Indoor unit,Purchased and installed on 3rd june 2020 it's working fine till now. Daikin is not providing electric wire and water outlet pipe as informed by technician charged me extra 600 over and above 1500 prescribed in the details by AmazonThese all thing should be made clear in the listing by Amazon
4,03-Jun-20,They came without sanitizer & gloves.,Daikins ac technology at is best in industries .
5,01-Jun-20,Extra charges,Great value for moneyGo for Daikin and super cooling effect
