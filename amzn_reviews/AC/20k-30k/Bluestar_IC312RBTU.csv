5,16-Aug-20,Truly Value for Money.. Best is it's an Indian Brand,"After weeks of constant research on my next AC, I zeroed down to Daikin 1 ton 3 star, Sanyo and this one. I finally went ahead buying this from local retailer as it had the best rate with exchange.Since ACs are to be judged basis long term review, I might change my opinion (hopefully that's not the case though) but currently when it comes to cooling aspects, this does it's job hands down. There is hardly any noise from both indoor as well as outdoor units.The installation too was in 2 days. So in this range you can surely go for it."
