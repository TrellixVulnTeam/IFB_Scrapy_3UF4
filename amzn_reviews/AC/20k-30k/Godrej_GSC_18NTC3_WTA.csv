1,08-Aug-20,Good Value for Money,Within few days it stopped working... Customer service is the worst... AC was idle from 5 months. They haven't come for repairing the AC... Please don't buy Godrej products. Better to buy other AC.

1,13-Jun-20,Worst product and brand for AC,"Horrible experience, stopped working on the very first day  just after 10 minutes of operation. Godrej after sales service is pathetic, they accept that it is manufacturing fault and some parts have to be replaced but even after two months of complaint they haven‚Äôt yet repaired, Don‚Äôt waste your money on this"
3,11-Jun-20,Nice one üëç,"Everything is Great except the moving swing blade of air conditioner. When we switch off AC, the moving blade doesn't shut down completely, leaving some space. This problem came out of the box, noticed it during the unboxing. Maybe purchasing a new blade of the same model may fix it."
1,08-Jun-20,Horrible product very poor quality,"Very bad product. The product doesn't have cooling efficiency. The company technicians visited asked me to return the product as they didn't know where to put the AC and they didn't have tools to hang it on the the desired wall. Installation charges are there by the company. First installation is not free .The product had return or replace option that's why I felt secured to spend money online for this ac . On the third after its arrival, after checking the performance, I raised a complaint by opting for refund or exchange and then called directly so this can be taken care soon and I don't lose my money.I spoke to a rep and explained the whole story and we did some troubleshooting over the phone but the AC was still not performing or chilling how it is suppose to at 18 degree temperature set.The rep said I will call you back after talking to my seniors if we can refund or exchange.Till date no one returned the call. The return date is also expired. My money wasted because Amazon didn't take proper action on time. Now the ac is hanging and performing as a local fan."
