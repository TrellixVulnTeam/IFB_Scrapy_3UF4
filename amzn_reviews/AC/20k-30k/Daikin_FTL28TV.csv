5,10-Jun-20,Amazing product go for it,"Excellent product, very poor service"
5,10-Jun-20,Box does not contain basics for installation,"Bought this AC after much deliberation as most reviews said that this ac is fit for 80-90 sq.ft. rooms, but took a chance given that my room was 120 sq.ft but now that it is installed and working, I must say it was the right decision! (the room got cooled in approx. 7-8 mins, which was unexpected). The best part about this AC is that the company provided both the copper wires with the unit (with insulation - see pic), which I did not get even with my 1-ton O'General ac which cost me double than this AC, so saved bucks there given that it costs an average of Rs. 300/- per meter. I bought most of the additional stuff beforehand including outdoor unit stand and MCB, however, I regret not buying the 3-core wire since I needed 6-mtr and it cost me Rs.110/- per meter while the rate in the local market is Rs.50 per mtr. Overall completely satisfied with this AC, though I regret not buying in Mar-20, when I was getting it for 3k cheaper on Amazon - bought this for INR 24,500 after tracking for almost 3 weeks on multiple sites, hoping for the price to go down to old level, but that did not happen (seems this model is in demand, thus no price reduction for now); if you can wait, you can get this once easily for INR 21k. Also, worth noting is that the unit I got had a manufacturing date of Sept-19, however, I have seen few comments where people got the Mar-2020 model, and another person in my locality also got the same - I guess it depends on the stock which is with the dealer from where your order would be fulfilled; better to get latest one if there is indeed no difference in price. Lastly, cooling from this one is AWESOME given that it is only 0.8 ton - now after 20-mins of operation, the room is completely chilled (120 sq.ft) and I had to move the temperature up to 25-degree (from 20). All-in-all satisfied I bought this product (you can check unboxing video on YouTube)."
1,08-Jun-20,Very Poor service!,"Next day after installation, water is coming out from the ac. Is it ac or shower! Helpline is also not supporting!"
1,08-Jun-20,"Excellent AC for its size, easily cooling a 120 sq.ft. room.",Dead on arrival. Getting A6 error just after switching it on. Now I have to wait for another 7 days to get this fixed. What kind of quality checks are in place for a brand new product which took 15 days to deliver at my place? Pathetic
5,08-Jun-20,Pathetic,Great AC. Very efficient and effective cooling. Better than any other costly AC brands.
4,06-Jun-20,Dead on arrival. Pathetic quality check,I m satisfied cooling and all are fantastic.But one thinks  are disappointed the indore unit screen are not present...
1,05-Jun-20,Very efficient and effective cooling.,Very poor installation from Daikin. Damage the wall paint. Water leaking after 10hrs. No bill given for installation. Charged more and over market rate. FYI already using 5 Daikin AC. Very poor experience.
5,04-Jun-20,First day I m very happy this product.. But wait and watch for more performance,Very good products
5,02-Jun-20,Poor installation experience,Completely happy. Only Installation issue from Daikin Service Centre.
5,30-Jun-20,Amazing product go for it,Definitely recommend this product
4,27-Jun-20,Box does not contain basics for installation,"It's best for any small room and very low in power consumption , please note that it is not inverter AC, Installation charges is very for compare to other ACs"
1,25-Jun-20,Perfect,Not working works for 5 min and stopes cooling
3,23-Jun-20,Nice Product From Daikin,Indoor unit box opened condition.Indoor unit drain hose and cable missing ..pls refund money for that....
1,21-Jun-20,Defected,Not worthy
4,14-Jun-20,Missing indoor unit drain pipe and cable,Good Product and Great & quick installation Service
5,12-Jun-20,Not worthy,Low sound perfect cool and more often Daikin brand
5,12-Jun-20,Good Product,Awesssooommeee... CoolingIts daikin so can go blindly for it.
4,12-Jun-20,Perfect buy,AC is good but not sufficient for rooms larger than 80 sq feet  and product is goodAbout the amazon customer service it was a worst feedback from my side i have waited for an hour to get connected and still no resolution on my issues I think amazon should work on my feedback
5,11-Jun-20,Great AC from daikin,"Bought after lot researching. Aince my room is less than 100 sq feet I chose this 0.8 ton Ac. I chose clouddetail vendor. I personally prefer him despite he charging a little extra. His delivery is very professional everytime!Smooth delivery within  a week. AC is September 2019 manufacturing. Next day installation. Installation people were very professional and did an excellent job!Paid 3000k towards installation and accessories. You can chose to get stand/accessories from outside. This would save money. Since it was lockdown I took from the company.Regarding AC: noiseless, chills room within half an hour. Smooth remote control, power chill option. What else do you need? don't know about units consumption yet ass less than a month.Advise: if your room is on top floor/ sun facing / filled with lots of furniture specially metal, books. Then I would advise you to go for a higher ton AC.Other wise this AC is perfect for small room.Enjoy your purchase!"
5,16-Aug-20,Amazing product go for it,There was a great experience.... Nicely & early delivered.. Thnk u amazon & seller
5,16-Aug-20,Box does not contain basics for installation,Quick Cooling make it more energy efficient .
5,14-Aug-20,Very nice AC,Value for money
3,13-Aug-20,The WOW AC,"I already have one AC installed. Performance wise very good. Except there is no temperature display on the unit. The remote has no light. Basically at night you operate in the dark.But issue is of the numerous hidden charges while installing it. Exorbitant prices for wiring. They charge for installing the drain pipe, even though it is just hanging after the first 2 feet.And none of their so called rates are ""fixed"".I was given an estimate of 7k + 1500. So i am returning the product."
1,11-Aug-20,Great,"The price of the A/C appears optically low. There are a lot of hidden costs involved.Firstly, you can get this installed only through Daikin. If you use your own AC technician, the warranty would be voidSecondly, the guys Daikin sends, is ridiculously expensive. They charge 1500 for installation, along with so many other charges like Stand installation charges (I purchased the stand myself, they charge extra just to drill 4 holes in the wall and fix the stand), plug charges, insulation tape charges. hose pipe charges, electrical wire charges. All these are absolutely necessary for installation of the AC and dont come with the A/CLuckily, I already had copper tubes installed by another AC technician. Otherwise would have had to pay a lot of money for copper tubes too.Overall, excluding the copper tubes, you will end up paying Rs. 3000 to 4000 per AC for basic installation. If you need copper tubes, it will cost you much more than this."
1,11-Aug-20,"Review based on Older Machine, Hidden Costs","Daikin installation team demanding more money as they are squeezing customers as we have no choice left without installation instead of 1500/- demanded 5000/- even though no extra items were needed such as copper tubes, electrical cable or stand etc.,"
1,10-Aug-20,Too many hidden charges,"Pathetic Installation by Daikin hired kabadiwalas....Day1 post installation after using it for an hour in evening, the moment I turned off, water from indoor unit started flowingThis after the installation kabadiwalas hired by Daikin , installed the indoor unit twice as first time they drilled hole and misaligned the indoor unit.Second time, they drilled again nearby and you see in video water gushing out of indoor unit"
5,06-Aug-20,Daikin installation team demanding more money as 5000/-,Wonderful product
5,23-Jul-20,Pathetic Installation,Ac cooling is very fast cools 100 sft room in just 10 min if you have a room less than 100 sft buy it with your eyes closed .installation was done in 2daysinstallation technician not experienced onedikine should properly train themyou should asked him to de vacuum the pipes and then release the r32 gasinstallation cost 1500 +200 for 3 core wireexpect the technician every thing is good
4,21-Jul-20,Worth a buy,Worth for money
1,20-Jul-20,Amazing product go for it,Ac not working since installing done and after complaining to company still no response

5,16-Jul-20,Don’t ever think so,working fine so far... still waiting for 2.5 filter
5,15-Jul-20,Best product,It’s extremely quiet and cools really well
5,15-Jul-20,woks fine..pm filter missing,"Dear friends, I have been using it for past one month and believe Me I am so glad that I took the decision to buy this one. Cooling is awesome, noise of external unit is also very low, power consumption is awesome - ranging from 700W to 750W. In actual it costs Rs. 5 to 5.5 per hour in my case due to standard cost of 1unit as Rs  7 in my apartment. I have observed it for many days so can confirm about its power consumption. My room size is 10x12 sq.ft. but it can cool it down in approx. 10-15 mins in powechill mode. I recommend you to go for it. Thanks"
5,13-Jul-20,Great cooling with quiet operation,excellent Ac.. using it for a week now.excellent product. 0.8 ton..but cooling better than 1 ton ac.. room size 10x12.. chilled in 10 minutes. have to operate at 26° as cooling too much.. silent operation.installation done in 2 hours. good installation. charges 4000... 750 for 1 metre extra copper pipe and 700 for 7 metre copper wire plus 600 for drain pipe... overall very good installation...
5,09-Jul-20,Awesome cooling and very light on your pocket,"1)Swing very very slow.2)No indoor temperature display.3)Night time remote buttons not visible (radium buttons not there).4)Remote always on, (there is no switch off button), so batteries fastly discharge.These 4 are major mistakes.Current bill very less,I like this Daikin AC,i will give 5 rating."
