1,10-Jun-20,Noisy,Don't go for Inverter AC. I Purchased with a huge amount in 2017 and since last year not working all the mechanics are also advicing not to go for inverter ac .Moreover this blue star company doesn't provide good service also .I am feeling just cheated
4,04-Jun-20,Awsum,"The product is Awsome as expected. I am using Bluestar AC from 6 years with no complaints and just ordered this one for my parents. It was delivered timely and its cooling efficiently. It also has a cute display in the centre of the unit.Lil cons are all around the installation though* I was aware that there will be installation charges but they were charging Rs. 975 just for installation + other charges. I had to call the customer service and took the installation guys on conference. After a lot of discussion early in d morning they agreed to charge Rs. 500 for installation. (They said the charges were Rs. 500 but were revised fron 1st June to Rs. 975 and my order was placed and product delivered and installation request raised in May last week)* They charged Rs. 750 For the AC stand. That was way too expensive comparatively. Rs. 500 for stand and Rs  250 for fitting it.* They charged Rs. 250/feet for the additional copper pipe. Which for some reason was 5 feet extra required over what was standard.* The wire from the outlet dint have a plug to it and it was a little short. So they kept it hanging like that and didnt even power it on to check if it starts. Ideally, they should have these essentials with them. But nevertheless, we had to connect the additional wire and try it on ourselves.Barring the installation hiccups, everything else about this AC and the brand is what i love so far... you can go for it as its one of the best brand when it comes to ACs in India. Its in the budget and best in quality."
