5,16-Jul-20,The mean machine - Daikin,Using the air conditioner from last 3 months and I can see why Daikin is number one. Great performance üëç. But energy consumption is more what I feel. Still it's a good product.
5,14-Jul-20,"Dear DAIKIN, please at least provide the basic attachments for installation",Very Good
5,14-Jul-20,Awesome brand.,"Pro:Timely delivery and installation during the COVID-19 situationCon:No LED indicator on the AC, you need to check remote for the same."
5,14-Jul-20,Very good one,Value for money
5,13-Jul-20,Best AC in the town,Like
5,11-Jul-20,Value for money,One of the best AC out there.Our room is on top floor and power chill feature chills the room within 10 minutes
1,05-Jul-20,Good,Warmth
5,04-Jul-20,I recommend this AC,How to extended the warranty.The remote stand is not available in box
4,03-Jul-20,Waste of time and money,Pros:Product is in good condition working very efficiently.Installation also done within 2 days of request with daikin.Daikin customer care people also responding very quickly.Cons:Installation charges are more than they are showing.Installation charges 1500+ 200 travel charge for installation guysOutdoor unit stand 850Extra copper pipe 2 meters 1900Power wire 5 metres 600Total 5050.
5,03-Jul-20,How to extended the warranty. The remote stand is not available in box,I believe in Daikin Ac product because I have been using one another Daikin since 2012 that's why I had ordered..But when we got Ac without kit that was bad experience for us to buy through online...I have paid extra 3500/- to service engineer to get that kit...Installation charge is too much high compared to other brand...It was total 4200/- (1500 installation + 1500/- hanging of compressor+ 1100/- electric wire & outlet pipe)...I have no doubt about this product. This product is really good having less noise & energy efficiency...
5,08-Jun-20,The mean machine - Daikin,Powerchill option chills your room quickly. Installation is big problem due to lockdown. Mine got installed after 1 month and that too from external vendor.
5,07-Jun-20,"Dear DAIKIN, please at least provide the basic attachments for installation",It‚Äôs working fine and chills the 170 feet room in no time. It‚Äôs silent. Power consumption is yet to be seen. Although dose the job bought for. I recommend it to all potential buyers. It‚Äôs seems to be a quality product.
5,07-Jun-20,Powerful AC,Excellent product ... I am using this product from last 3 months and it‚Äôs amazing experience.. cooling is great.. no other AC brand can beat daikin. Guys go for it  Without a second thought.  Noiseless air condition I must mention also..
5,06-Jun-20,Quality Product,Do the check pictures. I was with my 1st Daikin AC purchase. More than satisfactory.And after 6 month review.
5,04-Jun-20,Excellent,"Just go for it üëçüëç everything is perfect..fast cooling,low noise,consumes less electricity ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,03-Jun-20,Excellent product...,"Good and quick delivery by Amazon, product received in very good condition and installation service by amazon is also good. Ac is very good, we paid around 2000 rupees which includes installation and additional wire which was not provided by diakin."
4,03-Jun-20,"It's very nice,Go for this, perfect delivery, perfect product.","I bought this ac for 40k from Amazon couple of days back and it's definitely worth it and a great product by Daikin. You can always trust the brand and regarding installation, installation guy was a professional but I felt like installation cost was bit high if you compare to other brands. The standard installation was Rs.1500 which I knew I had to pay and there is no outdoor unit stand included with the product and they will charge you Rs750 for the stand and for safety purpose I bought Vguard stabilizer as well (4kv) due to high voltage fluctuate in my area. It's better to be on the safer side which costed me Rs 2500 and installation guy won't charge you for connecting ac to stabilizer as it is covered. Installation costed me Rs 3370 which is very high but the service was good , everything was done perfectly. It's too early for me to judge the product but I can say this as this one is better than other brands and it does cool your room in 3 minutes and noise level is very low. Go for this product you wouldn't regret it in future.:)"
5,03-Jun-20,Good product and quick delivery by amazon,Good
5,03-Jun-20,Worth it!,"Awesome product, just delivered in 2days and installation was also smooth"
1,01-Jun-20,Good,It doesn't get cool- not at all .Suggesting guys don't buy for it and get troubled as I am.
1,01-Jun-20,The mean machine - Daikin,Daikin service very bad and very late please don't purchase daikin ac
5,15-Aug-20,The mean machine - Daikin,Excellent
4,12-Aug-20,"Dear DAIKIN, please at least provide the basic attachments for installation",There is no display in the unit that will show the temperature.
4,11-Aug-20,Excellent,How can i achieved my warranty details of this product....???
4,08-Aug-20,No display on AC to show temperature,"Every thing provided is good including service,if the bill and guarantee card or atleast invoice be sent will be fine."
1,26-Jul-20,Issue a problem,"Does not provide cooling, service technicians failed to fix the issue even in 3 visits. Unit had manufacturing defects! Bought this to enjoy the few remaining days of summer, but got nothing but a frustrating experience. Lot of time wasted. Daikin technicians say that the unit does not have inbuilt stabilizer. Do not buy. Still not fixed. Seems like I wasted 43K to buy a fan!"
5,24-Jul-20,Invoice missing,Now l understand why all wanted Daikin ac s.it's working good..low electric bill comes. suggested 5star product..thanq Amazon
1,23-Jul-20,"DO NOT BUY, Does not cool enough!",No cooling at all
5,22-Jul-20,Nice and worthfull product..it cross the all expectations.,Happy with the productBut the installation charges are very high .I paid 3800/- for the installation of this AC.Please be aware of the Charges and think twice .
2,18-Jul-20,No cooling,"A/C unit works fine. No issue so far.Warranty is not valid unless installed by Daikin. Daikin is overcharging for installation.For us they charged the belowCovid travel surcharge - 400 (not sure who authorized them to collect, Amazon delivered the unit without any shipping charges or additional charges)Power cable - 600 (He comes with a cable, cuts it into two, connects from main power to external unit and external unit to internal unit. He claims, company provided power cable does not withstand the main power source!!)Tape charges - 150 (tape used on the insulation)Other charges - 100Icing on the cake - Daikin call support center informed me that installation charges for a 5 start inverter A/C is 599 + tax only, but the installation team charges 1500 if you buy from Amazon. Wonder what difference it makes to them for installation!!"
5,16-Jul-20,Not Happy With Installation Charges,"Great energy efficient cooling star!Pros -1) This draws a max of 6.75A only! So less heat on sockets2) No need of stabilizer - very wide power band3) Super silent - when i set temps to 28degrees i often look at the ac to make sure it is working, that is how silent it is. Outdoor unit is pretty silent too4) Chills to the bone, havent used this below 24 degrees at all, that too not more than 15mins, 27-28 sets the temperature to perfect levels5) Remote though not as per images is very useful and backlit led is great for nights6) Very energy efficient, I use my ACs for 12-14 hours a day atleast, and this one will save me so much money as compared to my other 3 star non inverter AC7) Daikin's installation - 5 stars - the guys spent 2 hours installing each AC (I bought 2) - meticulously routing wires/pipes etc. Also installation was done on same day of delivery in Noida! How about thatCons -1) Expensive (probably most expensive after ogeneral/mitsubishi)2) Warranty on compressor is 5 years only (Not 10 years) - there is super confusion around this3) Remote doesnt have slider to hide infrequently used functions (the remote as per image is not what is sent)4) Installation charges per AC were approx 2500/- (not even a plug in the box)5) 2 free services only - some brands give 3-4 free servicings6) No temperature indicator on the indoor unit. This is available in the JTKJ series but that is 4k more expensive and has bad reviews (gas leakage etc)7) some of the fins of indoor unit were bent (see photos), but not a deal breakerHave said the above I bought one more exact same model since it is perfect. I've had ACs of several other brands, but Daikin has proven itself over and over again. Wont go to any other brand again."
5,03-Jul-20,The mean machine - Daikin,"expensive on Amazon, I could have saved 5K by going to local electronics shop. Installation is in the higher side but product is brilliant"
5,01-Jul-20,"Dear DAIKIN, please at least provide the basic attachments for installation",Delivered in time and Installed in time. Everything is perfect. I am happy with Amazon service.
1,30-Jun-20,Best AC so far,One of the worst experience with Daikin air condition not even a month completed and the AC is not working... indoor unit is not working due to leakage of gas. Raised complaint to the service centre. After continuously follow up today Daikin team updated me that they will replace the indoor unit now. But but now there is a twist in the story that indoor unit is not available as of now so we will replace the coil. AC purchased for Rs.45500. which is Rs3000 expensive from the local market and still there is no solution. Purchased AC on 29th of June 2020 installed on 1st of July 2020 service centre people came in four days back but there is no clarity till now.... Good Daikin good.
1,25-Jun-20,Good Product with reasonable price,At time of installation. Company representative informed GAS of AC already leaked. It will not cooling now.After 3-4 day no one willing to hear complaint.
5,21-Jun-20,Daikin AC didn't work for a month....,"Good quality AC giving instant cooling. And also very economic in electricity bill.I got only 2200 rs bill of two months usage also having Washing machine, gieser, freeze, etc. Go for buying...."
5,19-Jun-20,Damaged and gas leaked,Perfect cooling and performance.
5,19-Jun-20,Very economic in electricity bill.,Good ac
5,12-Jun-20,Reliable purchase,"Awesome experience,"
5,11-Jun-20,Kno,"1. Each mode and each feature works perfectly.2. Super cooling, Energy efficient, silent operation.3. Remote controller is awesome. Easy to use.4. Aesthetics are also very good.You can blindly go with it."
5,09-Jun-20,The Most trusted brand,Diakin Ac is really awesome in terms of cooling and electric bill saving......price is too high but  one of best ac among other brands...just go for it......also super silent ac in sleep mode.........
