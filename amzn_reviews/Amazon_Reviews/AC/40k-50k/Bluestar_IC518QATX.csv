4,18-Jul-20,Commitment honoured.,"Wat an ac, cooling is beauty, cools so fast even in big rooms.but compressor sounds too much."
5,21-Jun-20,I think amazon selling defective products,Bought this AC an year back.. serviced twice.. both times they say.. the AC is perfect.. nothing needs to be done except for filter cleaning..Cools the room really fast and makes less noise compared to other ACs.. little overpriced but value for money
5,17-Jun-20,Awesome cooling,All the modes work great. The ac looks great and has tremendous cooling power. Works great for a living room or a big bedroom.
5,16-Jun-20,Best brand in ACs,"The AC is good performer, I don't feel its noisy as suggested by some reviews(every opinion matters).  The cooling is fast. Installation was prompt and was done on very next day of delivery. I have solar rooftop system at my home(4kw), this AC perfectly works on the same."
