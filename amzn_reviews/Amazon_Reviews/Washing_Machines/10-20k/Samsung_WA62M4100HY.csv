5.0,10 August 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,Easy to use and value for money
5.0,9 August 2020,Damaged front,I have been using this product since 2 years and it the best thing I could ask for. As of now I have not faced any issue with it and have even recommended to my family members. Two of my other family members are also using it and loving it.
5.0,9 August 2020,Perfect product for small family,"Value for money product, It has been 1 year, without any problem it is running. We overload everytime and works fine. Must buy product. But only thing is we have not received any installation we did by our self."
1.0,9 August 2020,Best product,"Never buy this product. I have purchased this in 2015. It is not working since 2019. I contacted cust. Care to resolve the issue. Engineer came from samsung submitted that motherboard is not functioning and motherboard can not be replaced as it is not available. When I contacted again, they do not respond me. Now it is lying abandoned in a corner of my house."
4.0,9 August 2020,Best product for the price || No installation provided,Good product
5.0,9 August 2020,Never buy this product,"I had used this machine earlier at my flat in Mumbai,Soon after I shifted I used it 10 times in I guess 8 hours with full drum load,Works great, very easy to use, I don’t think their is a different mode for tough stains or heavy clothes,I always use standard mode, Takes lot of water, 6-8 Buckets for 1 washI had purchased two such machines, got it on amazing price in dealSatisfied"
5.0,9 August 2020,Good product,It has been a month since i have been using the product.ProsEasy to use.My mom can easily operate the machineLow noiseValue for money.Compared with other products and found this at the best rangeEasy installation. The product was installed within a day of the deliveryConsDid not find anyOverall it is good producy in the given range
1.0,9 August 2020,GETS THE JOB DONE,"Defective model dont buy this, andamazon service also worst i have raised a return request but they are rejected. And i have lost my money completely"
1.0,9 August 2020,Amazing,Recieved damaged product
1.0,9 August 2020,Worst product and worst service by amazon,"Damaged product delivered.My previous review about this washing machine has been put on hold. No idea why?However, I have to write once again to know people. If they are blocking again then it means they are not letting know bad reviews about the product which is infact truth.I received damaged product, delivery boy said not to open till the technician comes and we did the same thing. When technician came and opened the carton, to our surprise it was damaged an shown in the picture.And it was difficult to contact the customer care service which is mentioned on the washing machine.Finally, when you receive the product open and check to make sure you got delivered product in good condition. If not in good condition then return them back. Otherwise you have to waste more 2-3 weeks.May be the washing mashing company is good the they delivered the damaged product and contacting them is horrible. It is not easy.Thanks"
1.0,11 August 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,"Cloths are getting torned in spin, especially long cloths, it gets tangled with other clothes badly after spin."
4.0,10 August 2020,Damaged front,"The product is good. Arrived on time undamaged. Colour and features are same as described in product specifications. The only issue was installation of product. It was mentioned that the service providers will come and install it within 48 hrs. But due to covid (which is no longer an excuse since all the services have been regulated and people are working normally), they didn't arrive. I waited for more than a week but didn't receive any call from Samsung unlike what has been written here.  I tried calling Amazon and Samsung customer care but it never connected. Finally I had to call a local service centre guy and get the installation done at my own expense which was supposed to be free. And got to know about the functions after reading the manual. This is the first time that Amazon has disappointed me with something like this. Satisfied with the product otherwise."
5.0,10 August 2020,Clothes are getting torned,Just go for it. Awesome product and good packing. Very happy with Amazon and samsung. Works really well. And got it for a good price. The installation was also done within 24 hrs of receiving the product. Good service.
5.0,10 August 2020,Good product but forget about the free installation.,"booked on Aug 5 2020, washing machine delivered on Aug 7 Friday 10 o'clock. samsung service person came on the following Monday and showed the demo in an excellent manner. my parents are happy with the purchase.

5.0,12 August 2020,Nice,"I have bought it one month ago from Amazon. Delivery and installation was too cool. It's nice to clean dresses..Pros : Totally Automatic , dual wash Technique , Good dryness , no need water touch and finally totally cool.Cons : It's take long time approx 40-45 min. You don't add water from outside because it doesn't calculate how many water is needed. and other problem is , if you want to change to any mode during working process...it should start from the core....it's painful and wasting time... So be careful while using.Thank you."

3.0,13 August 2020,Missing Accessories and damage,"in this price range, you can't get better. Clothes get entangled after wash. machine is powerful to wash off all kind of stains (i used Surf Excel detergent). spin is good. I bought LG washing machine in 16k 2 years back which doesn't has problem of entangled clotes and it's filter worked better than this. but still that was 3k extra. I dont think you will find any good washing machine than samsung in 13k."
5.0,5 August 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,Nice worth buying
5.0,5 August 2020,Damaged front,The monsoon feature is an added bonus.
1.0,5 August 2020,Nice product,"Samsung technician visited to me, ask me to connect the machine on water tap & power supply. then leave the place.now machine is huge vibrating during operation, my nabour are saying that machine is not balanced.kindly send technician to intall the machine & to support me how to operate machine. ( as there are many switches on the operating board)."
5.0,5 August 2020,Its a month since I bought this machine and its working well,Good Performance.  Clothes do not get entangled after the wash is complete.

5.0,5 August 2020,Good Performance.,Standard. Easy to use. Takes long time but that could be due to water pressure
5.0,4 August 2020,Overall good,Value for money.
5.0,4 August 2020,Good,"A compact and user friendly washing machine, Has functioned trouble free since purchase."
1.0,4 August 2020,Good product,It’s return policy is not for 30 days. I don’t like it and I don’t see any possibility of replacing it. I want to rerun the product. It does not seem original.
5.0,4 August 2020,Very user friendly machine,This was the second purchase of the same products.Blindly go for it.
1.0,13 August 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,Received defective product. Got the refund from Amazon and ordered again from Flipkart. They delivered it with utmost care.
1.0,13 August 2020,Damaged front,"Not sure where to start, I would rate it a ZERO if there was an option. The machine from the very well reputed brand Samsung and ordered from Amazon comes broken with multiple defects. The installation guys came in and unpackaged it noticing multiple dents on the machine and issues with the shocker.It is really DISAPPOINTING to have this experience when it comes from a well known brand and sold on Amazon. Was there no inspection done at the source or destination warehouse to make sure the appliance is intact? Why did the customer have to invest their time and money to finally receive a broken appliance. The only reason I bought this online was the trust on amazon, but its lost with this experience. I did see a review or two stating the same issue that the appliance came in defected, and ignored it thinking it’s just a one off scenario but doesn’t look like that, it seems pretty common for them to send broken and defected pieces.DO NOT buy this appliance online, it’s better to go in store and buy."
5.0,13 August 2020,Dented product- Amazon’s delivery is not satisfactory,Does a good job and dries the clothes well too. Its quite sturdy and provides a glass top view to see whats happening inside. The programmable options are sufficient and was quite pleasantly surprised by the drying capability of this machine. Wasn't expecting much but it does dry the clothes to a good 65-70%.

2.0,7 August 2020,Worst products useless warranty all repairs are chargeable,It was very disheartening to see that my new Samsung washing top load  machine had a breakdown within fourth day . It showed a small smoke coming from the corner of the dash board after the spin ended and the machine completed its wash .After that it never started . I have informed the SAMSUNG service center .Looks like I have been given a defective piece. My old washing had worked for more than 10 years

4.0,26 July 2020,It is ok,"I baught this machine in July 2020. It was well delivered on time and had good packaging. The body is sturdy as well as beautiful to look. It works very well and you dont have to worry at all. For installation I'll recommend if you can - watch you tube videos and do it yourself. It's easy no hard and fast rules there. As you would be getting calls from the company to send installation guy on n on till your machine is well working. I'm not sure but I thing they charge for installation. The buttons are good quality and led display is satisfactory. Tje only down side is its tedious to understand the various functions even though on getting a manual book.However it's worth the price . An absolute value for money. It's not that heavy. Yes required good amount of space. Wire and plug has approx 3.5 feet long and good quality. Drain hose pipe is ok quality. And the water inlet pipe is around 2 feet but is of good quality. One of the best washing machine in this price range with these many specifications.  Go for it, you wont be disappointed."

5.0,27 July 2020,Great,Very good product at very right cost
5.0,26 July 2020,Problems,"Received the product a few days ago in intact condition without any damage due to transportation.Some suggestions for prospective buyers (as I have read some negative reviews).1. Keep the machine on hard surface, in such way, that it doesn't budge at all.2. Go through the booklet, coming with the product, meticulously, you may yourself install the product. You may also download the pdf from Amazon's page.3. If you do it on your own, the only problem you may face is to attach inlet pipe with the tap. There are three detachable parts at the mouth of the inlet pipe (go through the booklet) on the side of the tap. I bought a tap with two stopcock (see the picture) ---- one for washing machine and the other for normal purpose. I have also purchased longer inlet & outlet pipes, as per my requirements, from Amazon (you may get 3 meter or 5 meter lengths of them). Remember, you will have to get everything ready (i.e. provision for electric and water line connection near the machine) before Samsung technician visits your home for demo purpose.4. Machine is so superb that it distributes laundry uniformly on its own inside the tub during its operation (rinse / spin), if not (not in my case till now), machine will signal and you may manually balance the same (go through the one page leaflet coming with the product).5. The noise produced by the machine is very normal with deep humming sound. In my video, the noise appears to be louder.6. Washing and drying quality is very good. I think, for four family members, at best 3 times washing in a week will suffice.7. There is a level mark L (low), M (medium) and H (high) inside the tub --- do not overlook for filling the tub with laundry.8. Do not mix heavy clothes with light ones for good washing purposes. For example, if you you wish to wash three bed covers, do it separately, and not mix with them with shirts, inners, etc.9. Preserve Amazon's voucher carefully, as Samsung technician told me 10 years' warranty on the motor, and any problem cropped up in future, that voucher will be needed.10. Only cons ---- consumes huge quantity of water, that I think, is necessary for any top loading washing machine, otherwise, keep electric and water connection on, then, press Power & Start buttons in tandem, machine will work on its own and will signal for end, then goes off automatically, for taking out 90% dried laundry out of it.11. My Samsung technician is good enough to explain several functionalities of the machine and also advised on proper maintenance of the same."

4.0,23 July 2020,Very good,EARLIER WE HAVE USED SAMAMSUNG 6 KG WASHING MACHINE FOR 10 YEARS WITH OUT ..MUCH PROBLEM.I AM EXPECTING BETTER SERVICE FROM THIS MACHINE
1.0,23 July 2020,Worth buying,Bottom of the machine is bitten by rats. Rat mat is essentially eaten away by the rats within 2 months of purchase. Cheap quality plastic and rat mat which doesn't prevent rats from entering the washing machine.
4.0,23 July 2020,SAMSUNG WASHING MACHINE IS A GOOD ONE.,"The price was a major plus point for this one. it has all the good things.. it does what it's built for. i just want to highlights few cons1. Needs too much water (this is the case with any full auto machines). it has 5 levels of water that we can select, even at the min it needs some 2 buckets or 20-30 ltrs of water per rinse and wash which is lot of wastage in my opinion. We should have been given option to intake far less water - because unless it gets the water it needs, it wont start - so we dont have an option to use lesser water2. Inlet pipe provided does not work with a little broader tap openings. the tap needs to be very narrow for the nozzle to work. for this i had to buy another 10 ft pipe which will connect to a narrow tab i had far away.Why cant the company provide a nozzle which will fit into any tap3. With the child lock on - i mistakenly opened the top lid and then the machine hang - the LED continued to display ""CL"" meaning child lock but no other buttons were working - i had to power it off and restart for it to work"
5.0,23 July 2020,Poor design,Good

1.0,22 July 2020,Not worth buying,"About the service from AmazonWhy sell a product where we have to reach out to the manufacturer right from installation call ...we could make a purchase directly with themMisinformation given and then no help other than quoting company policiesHave had to pay for the technician visit, when clearly the information on the page states Amazon will initiate a call to Samsung for installationAnd service agent too assured the same prior to purchase!And then imagine my surprise after all the incorrect information given by Amazon and spending INR 500 for installation service from Urbanclap the Samsung technician calls to offer a demo n installationSuch pathetic service n lack of information available with the staffAbout the productThis machine though being top load has to be interrupted after the wash cycle incase you want to use the fabric conditioner, it cannot be added at the start. Very inconvenient as one has to keep tab of the run times."

Some very little dampness is there (obviously) but I can easily iron and wear my clothes.It has an intelligent eco clean function which tells you when to clean the machine also. I liked this.

2.0,25 July 2020,Damaged front,Samsung installation and demo service called me after 2 weeks after delivery . They just needed the photo of the make and model number . They didn't give proper explanation for why they were late and they talked like I won't get warranty if this is not done and it would be my mistake.
3.0,25 July 2020,One of the best products,"The technician did not turn up for the installation even after giving appointments on two separate days. On the latter date, he claimed he couldn't attend because it was his birthday. I think a company such as Samsung can do much better than this"

1.0,17 July 2020,not gud for cleaning,Not only offline stores are giving 10years warranty on motor Samsung customer care also confirms this . So what's the difference here with the product . Thanks to me before purchasing it I went through the warranty description .I was about to place the order as I am using it from last one year which one I bought from offline store with 10years warranty. But here it says 4 years even Amazon customer care is also saying no it's 4years only . So I think I will not purchase this product and will ask everyone to check before you really make a mistake .

5.0,13 July 2020,very nice washing.,Everything is good about this machine but only two things bothers me - 1. the tub size which I had asked to change but since Amazon updated their return policy so I am stuck with this small tub size.They can only replace that too in the same model n size.2. Dry cycle : This is not as expected. The clothes still remain in damp state. Not that much drying as it was in the 7.5 kg machine that I used earlier.Don’t know if this is becoz of tub or what but the clothes only get 30% dry

Having had a very bad experience with the earlier washing machine, I was very sceptical to buy a washing machine -and therefore wanted to test this with a low cost machine. I'm very happy with the performance of this machine. It's easy to use, install. It's ideal for a family of 3 to 4.  Some users complain about vibration of the machine, not me.

Silent operation2. Super easy to use (Even for my mother)3. Doesn't require any descal powder for maintenance unlike so many other machines in market like IFB4. The technician told us we just need to put one glass vinegar for auto tub clean every 6 months5. Before starting the cycle, the drum rotates for few seconds to determine the load and then selects the water level (1-5) automatically6. A top load without agitator and hence gentle on clothes7. Standard drying time is 9 minutes and monsoon mode with 15 minutes and 30 minutes extension are super8. Same day installation by the technician9. Very helpful customer support on phoneCons:1. Machine has a magic filter inside which the technician told us needs to be cleaned everytime after use (This is little disappointing)2. The place to out fabric softener on the top edge of the drum which goes behind the body sometimes and then we have to rotate it to put it"

5.0,30 June 2020,Samsung 6.2 ltr,"I bought this machine with some hesitation, by seeing the mixed reviews obviously. But, before buying one should be clear of the requirements. If you want a simple, fully automatic, silent and cheap machine from a trusted brand, then definitely this is your buy.It performs the tasks well, sufficient for a family of 3-4(moderate use) and the best part is the cost effectiveness. I did apply another logic that, even if the machine is there with me for 5 years, the price is quite low to buy another after 5 years , so guys don't wait and stop searching."

5.0,25 June 2020,Hassle service,It is very easy to use. It doesn't shake. Clothes are getting washed too good. I liked it very much. It finishes washing in exact time. Clothes have become brighter.
5.0,25 June 2020,Damaged product received,I bought this machine a week ago and first of all i would like to say that it was delivered on time. Next this washing machine is pretty good at a reasonably low price.Samsung after sale service is as always good. The demo was done the very next day and the washing machine is working fine till now.
5.0,25 June 2020,Very good washing machine.,Excellent machine and for me the only choice among the other options.
4.0,25 June 2020,Good product at a reasonable price,"Nice Product, Value of Money"
1.0,25 June 2020,Perfect for a family size of 1-4 people,Bought this machine on 9th june and on 25th June the motor has got spoiled. it is a pathetic product and the way samsung is handing this is more pathetic and disappointing.
2.0,2 July 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,There is a bend on the front side of the washing machine.
1.0,2 July 2020,Damaged front,"Not operating properly, already raised request for return. Customer care told technician will come and verify. Then return will be processed. But no technician visited as of now. And unable to connect customer care today."
1.0,2 July 2020,Bend on the washing machine,Machine not taking water or it does not have inbuilt program for pulling water.. We are not happy with the product as water pressure is very low.. Not satisfied with the product.. Don't purchase this machine.
5.0,1 July 2020,"Automatic operation issue, need to return","Best product for two ppl family .. easy to wash.. jus put in clothes and power on, machine does everything else.. for small items like socks, handtowel etc, u can soak it in a mug for 5 mins and put it in machine .. salwar, shirt etc are washed neatly"
5.0,1 July 2020,Disappointed with product,Useful
5.0,1 July 2020,Superb,Please send someone for installation. Samsung hasn't sent anyone for installation.
1.0,30 June 2020,Amazon was very good products supplier,"This is quite an unfortunate incident what happened with us regarding this product. We had booked this washing machine and it arrived well on time. Amazon has been amazing in handling the products and arranging for installation all within the mentioned time. However, when the installation guy came to run the machine it was found that the balancer was defective and he suggested we replace the machine. Since the replacement stock was not available we were advised to cancel the machine and we promptly got our refund back.However since the brand is reputed and we had quite liked the look of the machine we decided to purchase it again. Again Amazon had been super in delivering the product. This time when the product was opened it was found that there were large dents on the body which could not be corrected. We had no other option but to replace the product again.My review is for mentioning how Amazon helped us both the times..they have been so efficient, polite and so prompt in their action. It was very very unfortunate to see how a reputed brand like Samsung was delivering such low quality products to customers without even running the quality check properly. Extremely disheartened by Samsung."
5.0,30 June 2020,Installation not done,Good product
5.0,30 June 2020,Received products with manufacturing defects,"Its very good. Easy to use. Washing is good, dont make much noise. I read reviews about like its not steady or vibrate too much etc, but nothing happened with us. Its bit vibrate while rinse but it’s obvious. Amazon delivery is very good and no contact as i got it around a month ago. But desappointing thing is Samsung installation process, as they not communicate or replie even after 2-3 days. When i enquired they said i asked them to postpone which is false statement. After 2-3 request someone came for the installation, he explained the basic things but he didnt setup the exhaust pipe saying like the machine level is lower. So i need to do it with plumber who again took some bucks. But overall good experience, value for money."

5.0,20 June 2020,G,"I have been using it for the past 20 days.. Product is pretty good.Pros:-silent operation-easy control-looks excellent, stylish design and colourCons- None from current experianceRecommentations- should have provided little more flexibility in handling the operation like an additional option to set control the timing of each operation(wash, drain, dry)  by the user itself.

4.0,18 June 2020,Damaged front,"Product is good, value for money. However there is a problem with outlet water pipeline. If you connect the outlet pipe which is at the very bottom of the machine, to the drain pipe which if even a little higher than the machine outlet pipe, the water flows out of the drain pipe and pours used water all over the floor. The drain pipe line should be lower than the machine's bottom. Then it works good."
5.0,18 June 2020,Not purchased,"This washing machine is just magical with diamond drum, I can rest a lot in clean linens having it at my service."

4.0,18 June 2020,Best,"Delivery was on time during the pandemic. No complaints with delivery or delivery guys. Here are the pros and cons after using the product for a month.Pros : Very easy to use. Brought it for my mom who doesn't know how to operate touch screen mobile but she is able to use washing machine.Machine's sound is less than what I've expected.Good for small family use. Serves the purpose.Cons : Inlet and outlet pipe's lengths are very small and had to buy another outlet pipe.Manufacturer people offers you to buy machine cleaning powder, stand and conver for higher prices.Thats all I can think as of now."

5.0,3 June 2020,One of the best automatic washing machine in this price range,"Sure is costly. I had to work 80 hours a week for two years to be able to afford this, but you get what you pay for. I put one old t-shirt that had been my pocha for years into this and it came out brand spanking new. So, I tried that with my ripped jeans, all the rips are now seams. Am on a roll now and at this rate, this machine is going to put Zara out of business. Just as well, during these viral times, we cannot safely go out and shop, so a machine that turns every clothing item into a new one every wash is a lifesaver. The only problem is that one of my cotton shirts has turned into a cotton plant after repeated washes. I will order some land and grow cotton from now on."
