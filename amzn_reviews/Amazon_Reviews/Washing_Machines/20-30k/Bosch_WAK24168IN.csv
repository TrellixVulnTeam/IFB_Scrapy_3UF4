5,25-Jul-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,The product is good however I have marked down on value for money because the after sales care is pathetic. One month after delivery and many calls/emails to Bosch we are still waiting for the warranty and the technician to come for a demo.  Would suggest going for a brand with known good after care even if you have to pay a little more
5,01-Jul-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Very good product and value for money
5,25-Jul-20,Machine shaking,"using it from 1.5 years, everyday I use almost twice because of my kids and working great"
4,24-Jul-20,Good but still not received warranty,I don't like installation schedule and after many request they installed it but not updated and I m getting to reschedule massages
1,24-Jul-20,Easy to use and Best,Recived a defective piece and returned it back to the seller
1,23-Jul-20,perfect üëå machine but poor installation process and still they not updated,Machine Not working properly...
5,22-Jul-20,Recived defective piece,Best washing machine ever
5,20-Jul-20,Too Bad... Ever i seen in Bosch,Good to go..
1,19-Jul-20,Bosch with amazon,"I have bought this machine last week, i am highly unsatisfied with this product as in the mix load cycle that claims clothes will be washed in 44 mins - it always take 1.5 hours for machine to complete that - and twice all the detergent was floating in the water even after 1.5 hours. Apart from this, twice it completed the cycle in 1.5 hours and all the clothes were completely wet - that is it dint dry the clothes at all ! Its total wastage of myMoney- i feel i would have invested in LG and would have got far better product that this."
1,18-Jul-20,Superb Machine.,It's tuf to use. Some options are not working properly.
2,18-Jul-20,Highly unsatisfied!,"Faulty product received, machine not working well some internal issue.Today first time i used it."
1,01-Jul-20,Machine shaking,"This product was delivered on 18th and on 26th when I used it first time it was found to be faulty as after the program ends it is giving me wet clothes with soap also in the clothes. I immediately informed the service engineer who came to install the Washing machine and he assured me to come on Monday i.e 29 th of June which was the final day of return window closure ,and I called him on Monday and Tuesday i.e yesterday and today also and finall he came today and informed the product is faulty and need some spare to be changed. Now why should I accept a product which is already faulty. So pls get it replaced on immediate basis."
1,30-Jun-20,Very good product,Installation.Its benn 30 days since the product got delivered but installation isnt done yet.Poor customer support from both bosch ream and amazon support.
4,29-Jun-20,Faulty product delivered,Product is good and easy to operate
5,28-Jun-20,Installation issues,Working nice
3,27-Jun-20,Product is good,"Waste of money. It does not take water in a proper way. In one and half bucket of water it washes 7kgs. Worst. There is no option to add more water. The clothes were stinking. They are not as perfect as we wash with hands. We use more water to clean the clothes perfectly. It doesn't matter how perfect the machine works, if it doesn't rinse properly in good amount of water then it's useless.  Clothes are not perfectly cleaned when it does not take more water. Also you don't have choice to rinse atleast 5-6 times. It does not take more water.  It does not rinse more number of times. It handly takes half bucket of water to rinse so many clothes, which just wets the clothes, forget about rinse."
5,26-Jun-20,Good,"Good ,i am using it from last 6 months,no problem as of now."
4,24-Jun-20,Worst intake of water. Water intake is very poor.,Installation guy is very rude and didn't even answer our questions properly. Demo was very bad.
5,23-Jun-20,Good,"What else to say about a product that gives you its very best each time you do your laundry? It's a quiet performer you can blindly buy. It is easy to operate and it keeps families happy! The maintenance may be a little more expensive than competitors, but can competitors ever match Bosch? Before, Bosch we had an American brand which we didn't use much as it used to tear up our clothes. We bought our Bosch after a friend had recommended it. That guy had bought a second Bosch after the body of his first Bosch had completely rusted away. After having  our complete satisfaction with Bosch, the one bought from Amazon was for my in-laws. They are happy too."
4,22-Jun-20,Worst service by instalation guy,"Writing this review after using the machine for one week.Pro‚Äôs>> more programs>> good wash quality>> less noise>> can change RPM level>> can add clothes in middle of the wash>> quick wash program (15/30 minutes)Con‚Äôs>> worst installation and worst service>> worst call centre>> Make sure to buy a stand if your floor is not even, else the machine will vibrate a lot>> installation guy will try to sell more products. They charged 250 rs for a nob to fit the inlet pipe to the tap"
5,17-Jul-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,I have received the product on 15th july and the installation done on 17th july. So many people mentioned about delay in customer service. But i have not faced any such problems. Overall quality of the product is the best. Without any second idea go for it.
5,01-Aug-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Noise level a little high but probably expected
1,17-Jul-20,Machine shaking,"I've bought model WAK24168IN. On Amazon it claims the programs such as Allergy Plus, Hygiene, Super Clean, Drum Clean. But what I got is the same model without these programs. Doesn't Amazon's own Cloudtail cheated me, with a mediocre model version. I researched and bought Bosch WAK24168IN based on these important features. Installation is still pending, don't know what more surprises, hope Cloudtail wouldn't have removed the components also. I could return, but carrying 2 floors of this heavy metal up and down without a lift refrain me from doing it. They also not delivered the filter, which is supposed to be part of the pack. Need to spend another ‚Çπ500 for the same. Cloudtail and Amazon are equal culprits."
5,17-Jul-20,Really worth every penny. Go for it!!!!,great onhe
1,14-Jul-20,Cloudtail and Amazon cheated me with this ‚Çπ30000 machine.,"Use less product, with in 2.5years of purchase two repair and finally inside drum is not working which is cositng 13k , can buy new washing machine. Don't buy bosch products, not value for money."
5,14-Jul-20,nice,Bulit quality
5,13-Jul-20,Worst product by Bosch,"Delivery was prompt, followed by installation by Bosch engineer. I got it delivered in 2 days and next day of delivery Bosch engineer visited my place and did the installation. Water input hose length is only 140CM so I paid 450 for extension hose which was available with Bosch engineer.Noise level is very low. It's just a week so can't comment on any issues."
4,12-Jul-20,Value for money,"Simply superb, worth every penny. Go blindly with it."
4,11-Jul-20,Good purchase,"Overall it is good, Easy to use, I feel its too small when compared to ifb and bosch service is pathetic"
5,11-Jul-20,Perfect product,Very low noise and I liked 44 min daily wash.
5,10-Jul-20,Happy with the purchaseüí∞üëê,Best product value for money üëç
5,31-Jul-20,Machine shaking,Very nice product. Great performance and completely value for money
5,30-Jul-20,Good,Bosch name is enough
5,30-Jul-20,"Very good product, go for it",Value for money
5,29-Jul-20,Must try good one,"Recently purchased this front loading washing machine 7kg. Worth the buy! No second thought if your budget is within 30K segment.* Very less Noise* No jerky feel* Less water consumptionNo complaints on machine.Only negative is regarding installation, people from bosh didn't even come after 4-5 days of wait, received 1st call on 5th day asking if he can guide me through call. Better watch installation video from bosh youtube channel and install it."
5,29-Jul-20,Go for it,"This is one of the best performing washing machines in the industry. I have experienced using LG, Samsung washing machines. But this Bosch washing machine is at a different level. The build quality is everlasting. Performance is phenomenal. Power and water consumption is half of any top loading washing machine and the wash quality is excellent. So, don't blindly compare the price and conclude that it is costly. It is definitely value for money in the long run."
4,29-Jul-20,Value for money,I use from 9 months.. Good results and performance..I contact to service man 2 to 3 time but not as friendly as others..Service man take money however there is no issue bill or anything else....
1,27-Jul-20,Excellent,This problem
5,26-Jul-20,Good working.. but No proper customer service,Smooth operation
4,25-Jul-20,West of money,Easy accesible for all age people and helpful
1,13-Aug-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,"I received a damaged product, current leaks out of the appliance and also affects the appliances kept near to it. I called for a technician from Amazon, the appointment was booked but the technician did not arrive."
4,13-Aug-20,Machine shaking,Good performance
1,13-Aug-20,The appliance was flawed.,It's not even working motor is not working water has blocked I need replacement u didn't even respknd
5,12-Aug-20,Good performance,"Got the delivery yesterday, nice transportation and handling from Amazon.The machine is heavy and sturdy, no vibration. I called the Bosch toll free number on the day of delivery for installation request and got same day visit for installation. Great and quick service from Bosch.Had to buy the inlet pipe (genric) as the inlet pipe provided by Bosch don't come with adaptor to fit with the tap. And only adaptor was hard to find in the local market. So the pipe cost me 300 Rs.I guess Bosch should atleast provide such small accessories to fit in..Max washing temperature in this model is 60 degree however the model just above this is having 90 degree max washing temperatureOver all satisfied with the product."
4,12-Aug-20,Waste product,Really make good decisions buy this product. As always Bosh is leading brand. Hope in future service also be good.
5,11-Aug-20,Perfection from Bosch,Value for money
1,10-Aug-20,Bosh reviews,"Got the delivery of Bosch washing machine on 2nd June, till date none has come for installation and demonstration.  I have called the Bosch call center several times, they keep assuring to send the technician but till date none has come for it. Regret buying this washing machine."
5,10-Aug-20,Good product,We need a installation. Please do help us with that.
5,09-Aug-20,Worst Customer Service.,"We brought this machine in Oct 2018, after using for 2 years, I am writing a review, the machine is working absolutely fine with low noise, you need to go near the machine to check whether it is ON or not , before we were using IFB se√±orita plus which used to make lot of noise like generator and used to move 1 to 2 feet from its original place, I highly recommend this product"
1,09-Aug-20,Installation,Received a damaged product.
4,08-Jul-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,It is good product  & works  smooth and easy to house purpose. Thank  u Amazon.
5,08-Jul-20,Machine shaking,The machine is fabulous it cleans clothes and keeps them in good condition doesn't damage the clothes where as other machines do it while washing them the installation process is really very simple but when you order the machine you have to buy a small adaptor which connects to your water line a small thing but creates a big issue other wise the machine is seriously amazing
4,07-Jul-20,Bosch  washing machine  7 kg front  load.,The front gasket is hopeless
5,05-Jul-20,Dont think to much just buy it,Worth for money
5,05-Jul-20,Gasket,"Cleaning is perfect, little bit noise on rinse after 3 year of use."
5,04-Jul-20,Worth spending,Best product in fully automatic. Every one says fully automatic machine has problem with rats but Bosch is totally protected from rats. No words go for it.
5,03-Jul-20,"Good cleaning, good service",It's a quality product. Value for money
5,02-Jul-20,Good product,Best Product. Go for It.
5,02-Jul-20,Best one,"I got the best deal in diwali. Talking about this Washing machine, Name is enough to show its potential. ""Bosch"".  Noise level could have been better but apart from that it's damm powerful. Automatic Warm water facilities helps a lot. Extra detachable nozzle for cleaning is a big help. RPM is so good as compared to Samsung and LG. Go for it."
5,01-Jul-20,Value for Money...,value for money.
1,11-Jun-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Call me NOW
3,10-Jun-20,Machine shaking,My product's installation has not been done. I was out of my residence for sometime because the electricity and water supply there was disturbed. I would request the authorities to fix a date for installation as soon as possible.
4,09-Jun-20,Call me now otherwise I will return,The washing machine is one of the great choices you can make in the market but I rated it low only due to the delay and lag in services.The machine arrived late and took another week and a half to get installed. I had to make multiple calls everyday to the customer centre.Even though the response took time it was genuine due to the covid situation. The Bosch company person did the installation very professionally and gave a great demo.This order will be a good choice but only if you have the patience to sail through multiple follow ups.
3,08-Jun-20,no installation,this products isgood but service is worst and spare parts very costly
1,07-Jun-20,Delay in service,Seamless delivery by Amazon. Too much noise. No one from Bosch has visited demo yet. No one has called either for the installation. Too confusing. No one available for assistance.ThanksHanmant
5,07-Jun-20,himoney low service,It‚Äôs a Fantastic Product which works with full efficiency.It doesn‚Äôt create any noise and distrubance the only drawback is the drain pipe which is very short(1meter) Remaining everything is good and Accurate.
1,06-Jun-20,Too much noise and no installation assistance from Bosch,"There is no demo for the washing machine, even the telephone call are not lifting"
3,06-Jun-20,Easy to use,"I bought this washing machine on 28th Oct'18. It was working perfectly fine upto yesterday, today 6 June'20, it heated up and not starting.  I called customer care number 8067521111. Bosch representative advised to call them on Monday. Is there any online method for registering complaint ? Thank you for prompt help !!"
1,04-Jun-20,Waste of time and money,Bosch machine turned to a disaster for us ! Loud noise & high level of vibration the machine turns 360 degrees from its position while washing & drying cloths ! DisappointedDefective machine is being delivered!
5,02-Jun-20,Service Turn Around Time in India ?,Superb Performance very low noise level. Value for money product
5,16-Aug-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Not a single problem till now. It's been more than 1 year. Loved the quality.
5,17-Jun-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Don't get distracted by those bad reviews. This washing machine is value for money. The washing machine was delivered within 20 hrs of placing the order and the installation was done the very next day of the delivery. I don't understand why people keep on complaining that the installation is delayed. Maybe they should consider the fact that probably they themselves live in some remote area and should not expect everything expedited to their will.This machine is one of the best and does not deserve anything less than 5.
4,16-Aug-20,Machine shaking,good product
5,16-Aug-20,Very good product,"It's a great Product, I have uses mostly Semi-Automatic machines only. This is my first Fully Automatic Machine and I feel purchased the right product. The delivery is on time as they said and the installation & demo are very fast. Quick response from the Service center and in an hour the Technician (Mahuboob Basha) from Indian Enterprises came to my home for installation. He explained in a very understandable way. Even the Manager (Mr.Chakradhar) gave a very quick response, Service delivery is very quick..like in an hour. I was to give more than 5 stars..."
5,15-Aug-20,good,"Design is very good. Machine works silently, you do not feel any disturbing sound or vibration. A little bit vibration/noise feel only at the time of spin only, but it is also not disturbing sound. Fully satisfied with product. But you can buy 8kg series 6 (this is series 4 model) also with extra spending of Rs.1500. Please do full comparison of models from flipkart also before order."
1,15-Aug-20,"Awesome Product, value for money..best product",Poor
4,15-Aug-20,"No vibration, no noise, best performance",It's been 7 days and no one has come for installation of the machine. Pathetic service by Bosch...Sad to see this from a world renowned company.
5,15-Aug-20,Poor,"Bosch always keeps its brand values no compromise is Quality , FunctionalityRecommend this product since I have been Using Bosch and ever seen any problems till now"
3,14-Aug-20,Installation is delayed beyond limit,"We had bought a Bosch washing machine in 2016. E-17 was the error which used to come everytime during the washing process. After 4 years of.xontacting some service cwntre or another, we finally lodged the complaint which was addressed at Delhi. Bit it took seven days for the technicians from the service centre to.figure out the problem. 3 technicians worked on the issue. As per them, the actual problem got rectified but the door closing sensor malfuntioned which after 7 days, they told it is beyond them. You get it checked from someone else.It has been a pain staking week as we have been stuck up because of rheaxhine being unserviceable. Before the machine was opened by the technicians from rhenservcie centre, atleast it qorked with the error coming and going, but now it is not coming ON itself. Buying such a costly product, of a valuable conapny has left us with only a scrap, not knowing what to do with it. I really don't know whether Bosch machine servicing and repair can be done in India also or not. But it has sucked our hard earned money and left with no option but to wash out clothes with hands."
5,14-Aug-20,Bosch keeps the Brand Values,"Less noise as i wanted, nice machine."
1,13-Aug-20,Not worth,If you buy this machine cause review are goods. Thn you will be in big trouble...No doubts about quality of Bosch company....but Service in mumbai area is really horrible...right from installation you will find difficulties.... finally you will fed up...it's a big headache actually.....
5,17-Jun-20,Machine shaking,I bought this Machine last year and now writing review will justify this buy. I am pretty happy by using this model. I hv checked and used almost every rinsing mode and pretty much satisfied. Till date I have not faced any problems.
5,17-Jun-20,Go for it.,Very good product and nice service. Machine vibrate for moment while catching speed.
5,16-Jun-20,Happy buyer of Bosch Washing Machine,Super company
5,16-Jun-20,Excellent,One and only Bosch is the champion
5,15-Jun-20,Super company,Am very happy with the purchase :easy to use and simple operations.
1,15-Jun-20,One and only Bosch,"Don't buy this product. Its very vibrating and noicy. Also, no one from Bosch customer care and Amazon Customer care help you for that. Even this product having replacement option but Amazon is denying for that also. I am not sure to whome I escalate and who can help me."
1,15-Jun-20,G√≥od product,Not able to reach Bosch service for installation
5,14-Jun-20,Very bad product.,Best in class... must buy
1,12-Jun-20,Not able to reach Bosch service for installation,Still installation  is pending from Bosch...So irritating this is...Plz do something..I had complained 4 times but isn't responding
4,22-Jun-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,very nice product
5,22-Jun-20,Machine shaking,Good quality product
1,22-Jun-20,nice,"I hav new one, which am using as a stand now...bcoz the bosch person did not installed it. Hav called them 10times or more still no use. Amzon delivered the washing machine within two days, 14 days over still bosch could not and install it..!!!!!POOR service... didn't expect it from bosch."
1,21-Jun-20,Good quality product,"Do not buy Bosch products. The service is the worst in India. They don‚Äôt answer calls. Toll free number doesn‚Äôt work. When you finally somehow get in touch with the service centre that is if you are lucky, they are the most incompetent people. I bought this dishwasher and after 2 months it stopped working. Since then I have been after customer service everyday. When they finally sent someone to check it out after a long time that fellow was incompetent. He ordered some part that was working completely fine. Again the next technician tried to diagnose the actual problem and ordered another part. They said it will arrive in 4 days. It has been 6 weeks now and they are just stalling. I guess the products of Bosch are defective along with that they have an equally incompetent customer service. I have faced same problem once with Bosch washing machine which stopped working and the service person had no idea what happened so that‚Äôs a waste now. So my advice is for any appliance it is better to avoid Bosch"
1,21-Jun-20,Very Bad service of Bosch,No one from Bosch has bothered to come for installation despite our contacting their service center on our own even after five days of purchase. So please purchase Bosch washing machine from Amazon only if you want to use it as a showpiece to show your guests and not use it for washing clothes.
1,19-Jun-20,Do not buy bosch,"Delivery by deliveryart is very bad.my Flat  is on 3rd floor , the home delivery refused by delivery boy on 3rd floor,he told me to where is facility of lift. So he force to me to collect the product at parking zone or arrange to coolie.After discussing with other local Amazon delivery boy, he is ready to deliver product with the help of other 2 people. Then with the help of  friends the  home delivery done .  Also received boot material in damaged condition.only 3 boots received to me.  Moreover, received machine on 12 june ,but till as on no any technician came for installation. Now 10 days completed, but installation not done.I will give another review after installation of machine"
4,18-Jun-20,Pathetic service of Bosch,Machine works fine but water filter is missing with my machine.
5,18-Jun-20,"Home delivery and damaged , missing item, installation",Unfortunately size dimensions does not suit to me
4,18-Jun-20,Missing water filter,I bought it last year and have had no complaints till now. I will breakdown the review into parts1. PackagingIt arrived in original box and it was unwrapped after delivery by Amazon guys. The packaging was pretty good.2. InstallationEven though i have done lot of research on how to use it I still opted to wait for the installation technician. Before the installation guys comes do have Dishwasher salt + Rinse aid liquid + Detergent ready. Theses can be bought separately. There is also a tablet which has Detergent + rinse aid but its costly. You also may need a stand and cover for dishwasher.3. UsageAfter the demo I kept fully soiled kadhai & tea vessel and let the machine run on 'Intensive kadhai' option. The program run for 1 hr and I got sparkling vessels. I took photos of the output and shared with all my half knowledge friends and that relative who gives philosophy about buying gadgets. They were shocked with result. :)This will resume from where it stopped in case of power outage.4. MaintenanceThe downside of owning a dishwasher are that periodically you need to open the waster collection basket and wash it. I do it once in 2months. Also the detergent and rinseaid are costly but in the long run it saves you from frustration of washing dirty vessels.5. WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS- If you don't want to depend on your maid.(Now during lockdown its a life saver)- If you want steam sanitized and 100% dried utensils.- If you have space to accommodate this machine in your balcony. Kindly look at measurements and decide.6. WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BUT THIS- If you have a maid who never takes leave & cleans the dishes with towel after rinsing.- If you want to listen to you friends and family who give gyaan without using this.- If you fail to realize the value of this machine in the long run.- If you are even lazy to load and arrange the vessels properly inside this dishwasher.- If you do not have space for this.Ultimately its your choice do dishes the manual way or the Bosch way.
1,18-Jun-20,Classic,No one visited for installation sofar.. Amazon has delivered on 12th of Jun ..till this time not hard anything from Bosch nor Installation ppl
4,09-Aug-20,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,Thank you Bosch and Amazon for giving such kind of products and services but little disappointed with small dent at right corner side
5,08-Aug-20,Machine shaking,Writing a review after using 1 month. Product is very good and easy to use. The delivery and installation was not that prompt but I am satisfied with the product.
5,08-Aug-20,Good product,Awesome product..its a beast...i have used many washing machines but this one is awesome.. washes the clothes very neat..
1,08-Aug-20,Very good product,"Product features not matching with the product mentioned on Amazon ..though model no. Is same WAK24168IN. Kindly find attached photographs of machine I received . And you can compare this with the product photos given on amazon. functions are different. There is no hygiene function. There is no saree function and no drum cleaning at 90 degree. Don't bye this from Amazon..it's impossible to talk to customer care of Amazon or seller who sold you this product, Cloudtail india. I am left with only  option of accepting whatever I received and be happy with whatever I received. Well machine yet to be installed. So can't comment on its performance at present."
5,08-Aug-20,Aswesome machine..Value for money...,Very good product
