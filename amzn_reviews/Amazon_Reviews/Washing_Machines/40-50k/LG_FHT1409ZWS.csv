4,04-Aug-20,NOT VALUE FOR MONEY,I liked the delivery of the product by Amazon. I purchased this product from Amazon at the price of 44990/-. And also the machine is easy to use. It actually worths money.
1,15-Jul-20,Amazing service,"Disclaimer: I bought this washing machine from a local electronics Store not on Amazon. It's also written after a frustrating call with the customer service rep where they couldn't give a satisfactory answer and just gave up. However my feedback is more for the product designers as the current features are super inconvenient to the typical Indian user.The users of this product are not just tech savvy youth, but also busy maids, elderly parents and busy couples where convenience is more important than bells and whistles. My excitement of getting this washing machine turned into criticism pretty soon:1. Default option is set to cotton which is a 3 hour! program. And get this: you cannot change the default cycle. If you need a faster cycle, you have to select it every time you turn on the machine. Also selecting a cycle is not sufficient as you need to almost always change the options such as water temperature or spin rpm. So a few more buttons with some fancy displays. Enjoy explaining this to your parent or maid... You suddenly start missing the cheap alternative with a physical dial that was set once and forgotten.2. There is a faster cycle which lasts only 1hr 40mins (and one at 14mins?) but you have to select from the predefined program only. If you want to change the water temperature to cold instead of 40 Celsius, or change the spin rpm, you have to customize the plan and click through multiple keys EVERY wash cycle3. The remote start seemed cool and I thought I could use this to operate if it turned too complicated for others. But, to initiate remote start I have to go physically to the machine punch a sequence of steps and then go back to my desk and then turn it on and feel cool about it4. Oh and you can't find any custom options in the remote start. So if you decide that you want warm water instead of cold, you need to make the journey back to the machine and give it loveI guess a lot of this would not have been an issue if the default cycle was an hour long, but because it took an insane 3 hr cycle every time, I had to get into configuring this right and got into exploration mode.Btw the customer care in the lg iq app needs to improve. The rep doesn't understand English and needs an interpreter. And if you ask questions on product use, knows how to hang up the call."
2,14-Jul-20,Awesome product.,LG service is very poor. I called LG customer care again and again but he is not responding and Amazon also is not respond. 10 days replacement is not fullfill by Amazon.
5,04-Jul-20,Operating this daily is a headache,Absolute value for money. Top notch product. Low noise. Easy to use. Excellent build. Various modes for different cloth types. Spin dry mode at 1400 rpm leaves clothes almost dry and a few minutes in the sun will dry them completely. You really wouldnâ€™t miss the lack of a built in dryer. Very happy with the purchase.
3,02-Jul-20,Poor service LG and Amazon,"Machine received on time, but body damaged condition,"
5,23-Jun-20,Absolute VFM!,This is the best washing machine I ever had. Very silent functioning.
5,21-Jun-20,Delevered damaged machine,"Very good under 45k price point there are many options but lg service is good and fast. wash quality is good i like the feature turbo wash which reduces the time without compromising wash quality. I mainly like the wifi option when connected which lg smart thinq app it shows everything like power consumption, remaining cycles to tub clean, and it gives notification to ur phone after each wash and also u can diagnose errors with app. The con i notice is in higher spin it you can hear vibrating noise and touch controls could be better"
3,17-Jun-20,Best in the market,Water regularly leaks from the front. Not getting a fix. Frustrating.
5,15-Jun-20,Good machine,"Got the product delivery on the same day. Installation was done within a day. Machine performance is flawless, almost no noise. Mobile app for monitoring and downloading new modes are helpful. Due to Inverter motor vibration levels are very minimum (almost negligible). Wash quality is topnotch."
