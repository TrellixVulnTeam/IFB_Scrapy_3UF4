5,15-Aug-20,"Sound less, good wash quality and nice performance",I am reviewing this product after using it for a week.I will also update my review after 6 monthPoints Needs to take care before installation:- Tap fitting for washing machine- 15A Point is required (Normal 3 pin will not work for this machine. 15A is required)- Stand made up with granite stone (I dont want to put machine on stand provided by a company)  If you wish a granite stand then you have to ready it before one day (24 hrs) of installation  Machine Size - 62.3 cm (24.5 inch) Width X 59.8 cm (23.5 inch) depth  Granite Stand Size - 26 inch Width  X 28 inch depth (23.5 machine depth + 5.5 depth extra for RO filter)Other Details:I got this machine on the next day i have ordered it. I bought this machine on Prime deal sale so it costs me Rs 38500.I have also purchased Ro filter (Rs 2560) + Other liquids (Rs 2200) + Cover (Rs 650) . So you need to consider this extra cost while purchasing this machine . I didn't purchase washing machine stand as i already have granite stand.I always want a big drum size so i purchased 8.5 kg to accommodate maximum clothes. Sound of the machine is quite silent. It also dries clothes 90%
