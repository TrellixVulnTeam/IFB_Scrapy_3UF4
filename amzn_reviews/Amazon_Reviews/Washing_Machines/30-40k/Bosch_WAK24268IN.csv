1.0,1 August 2020,Received damaged product,"Amazon delivery is 3 rd class+ bosch India customer service is very bad, online purchase if failure as defective pieces are sold online, when the machine has 4 nuts below, i got with 3 nuts. The machine is running in our bathroom 2 people needed to hold it firm.... German engineering with Indian service support......What a deadly combination....Still the service guy has not reached to install the machine......After 15 day and regirous follow up...And the worst and funny part is the Bosch call centre guy asked me why u purchased it and started blaming me for failure of product..!!! So bottom line...If u want get humiliated Bosch is best one to buy"

4.0,26 July 2020,Probably the best you can get under 30K!,Using since two years..working well..installation of the machine is problematic because the company has no skilled persons at some small towns and cities..they send the persons hiring local persons...But the machine is quite good in performance

4.0,31 May 2020,Very nice peoduct,The product is very good. I am using it since two years and until now no complaint about it. Fully functioning well. From my experience since two years I didn't need service engineer visit.  Honestly happy with the product.
5.0,23 May 2020,Good,"After using it for a year now, would say its the best in this segment. Even better than its pricey rivals. Best built quality and awesome heavy duty motor. It just works very silently. You cannot hear noise outside the room. The wash quality is just awesome. The 15 min function is very very helpful for fast washing. The door material is tough glass which is plastic in other companies. The machine also has 1200 rpm rotation which dries the clothes efficiently. Blindly go for it.."
1.0,21 May 2020,Strongly Reccoment for the product.,From the day I bought the washing machine all the clothes are getting torned. I have complained during initial days but of no resolution nor fix. It is a defective piece and company wasted 2 years without giving any proper resolution. Now the warranty expired. NEVER BUY THESE ONLINE. LOT OF CHEATING AND FRAUD BY THE COMPANY.

5.0,20 May 2020,Clothes getting torned from the time purchased,I bought this machine on 24-10-18. Easy to use with so many options. Allergy plus feature is so helpful especially in corona time.Almost 1.5-2 years old machine but still works like a new. Less noise. Bosch is awesome.
