5,15 August 2020,this product is not good,Nice packaging and impressive looks
5,15 August 2020,Best product,"This is my second IFB washing Machine.  This is smaller in size, heavier in weight, more steady and stable.  I had old stand and I love that there is no shake like the earlier one.  Smooth function, is slower than the earlier machine and also makes lesser noise.  There is no leakage from the door and any part.  This time it appears technology has improved and is at its best.  After reading lot of negative reviews I was a bit apprehensive but the first time use told me I am better off buying IFB again.  The program selector jog dial is so soft that there is no struggle, that means less wear and tear and ultimately no tears.  Once select the program, fill it, shut it and really forget it.  Come back later to collect your laundry washed and dried.  Great Product.  I wish you too have good luck like me."
5,15 August 2020,Ifb delivery review,"Nice machine, no issues till now."
1,15 August 2020,"Great Product, technology at its best.",Be VERY careful in buying Appliances from Amazon. I have had a very Bad experience. I bought an IFB Washing Machine from Amazon. Delivered to me Last Wednesday the 12th August’2020. Today is the 15th August’2020 and nobody has called up for Installation. We are Senior Citizens and the maids are on leave so me and my wife are washing  clothes ourselves.This is the special treatment that you get when you are a PRIME MEMBER only.Thanks to Amazon. We would now shift to Flipkart or any other good service providerwho care about their clients.
5,14 August 2020,IFB is best,Very good quality
1,14 August 2020,RD Prime Member since 2014 - Disgusted,"IFB not installed washing machine properly, water leakage issue. Water Hardness filter was deffective (water leakage issue). IFB charged 1850 for filter and provided poor quality filter. You can buy good quality water hardness filter on Amazon at lesser price. Also IFB not yet  replaced filter .Very bad after sales service by IFB"
4,14 August 2020,Very good Machine,Good Product.. Noise level is quite low also black matte color is awesome
4,14 August 2020,Poor After Sales Service by IFB,Machine is good. Amazon delivery was amazing. Received latest manufactured machine.
5,14 August 2020,Worth to buy it as per price,Best one

5,30 July 2020,Good machine,Good Product And I Received Recent Manufacturing Product...Nice...
1,29 July 2020,Good purchase,This order I'd 1337473159886My ifb order product in package doesn't found me any garantty and warranty paper only receive bill only.
1,28 July 2020,Good Product,I have been contacting amazon customer service n IFB for a missing part in washing machine. Stil issue is not resolved.It's been more than 1 month since issue reported and around 12-15 mails and  7-8 calls have been made.Ifb amazon agent (Sayed anwar 063609 01463) who came to check never came back and did not fix. These agents do not respond calls.Noise level at times is too high & shakes up too even though clothes are below recommended weight
4,27 July 2020,Where is my warranty and garantty papper,The product delivered at that exact date of delivery..the support team was up to mark..at this budget a great washing machine from a brand like IFB..so go for it..
5,26 July 2020,"a branded product, dont get the installation done as ...","Using it since 18 months. Bought it for 21k.The machine is working fine without any problem but maintenance is a bit high. Need to change the filter candle and clean the machine with powder every 2 to 3 months. Additionally at the time of installation  u need to buy stand,filter,stabilizer which costs around 5k. Gets overloaded while washing heavy blankets and bedsheets. Takes too much time than other machines.4 years complete warranty is very helful."
4,26 July 2020,this product is not good,Please dont go for samsung or lg. IFB is the best to buy and very much recommended. Its been one month i am using it. You need to keep a watch when its rinsing at its full speed to avoid any damage other wise its the best product
5,26 July 2020,Missing part - not yet fixed,"Delivers a clean wash, doesn't destroy the fabric,  hot water wash is really good."
1,20 July 2020,Good product,Pathetic after sales service by IFB. Will never every buy IFB product again.
4,20 July 2020,Recommended,No timer
4,18 July 2020,Afrer sale service is bad .,"I recommend everyone, good for small family."
5,17 July 2020,No timer,Nice product
1,15 July 2020,IFB,Pathetic service. Didnot even use once. No one from IFB responding
4,14 July 2020,Good washing machine,Good
1,14 July 2020,"Pathetic service, installation and demo not done properly",Worst product.Don't buy it.Machine always showing error.Bought last week only.Received broken product.
5,13 July 2020,Good,"It took along time to finalise my front load washing machine due to extree reviews fr almost all brands... I am very happy with wwashing machine and demonstration happen with 48hours...i was askwd abt stand and i denied...stand is required only for mobility, specially cleaning the place where machine is placed"
1,11 July 2020,"a branded product, dont get the installation done as ...",Dont Buy any of the IFB products. After u buy u cant got any service support from ifb. So careful friends. Machine work good for 6 months. After it show so many trouble. Then u call customer care there is no proper response . So avoid ifb products.
3,11 July 2020,this product is not good,IFB should send a proper person for demo. The demo guy who came started complaining about the washing machine saying this is too basic model not good for anything. He told whatever he has to say to sell his products. Company should hire proper service persons.
3,09 July 2020,IFB is Fraud,Got cheated by IFB and Amazon.In fully automatic washing machine they provided only one tray for detergent and fabric conditioner.Even after several complaints for 20 days waiting also Amazon did not solve.
5,06 July 2020,IFB demo is the worst,Nice working fine
5,05 July 2020,Got cheated by IFB & Amazon,Excellent product
5,05 July 2020,Good machine,Good one.. I bought the stand.. machine doesn't come with stand..
5,03 July 2020,Excellent product must buy,Produces  noise too much while spinning .but washing is decent for daily use clothes.. over soiled clothes won't get washed easily. Perfect for single individual use
1,01 July 2020,Less noise nd stable..,Screws observed rust without started using this only says how Quality IFB maintained i am not at all satisfied v.poor Quality and installation people also don't no about the machine operations they are not shown about filter cleaning system which is v.v importent their much interested to sale  extra accessories
5,01 July 2020,Tough to was over soiled clothes,Good
4,01 July 2020,Poor Quality,Good
5,01 July 2020,"a branded product, dont get the installation done as ...",Very good
1,28 June 2020,this product is not good,"Hi, IFB has downgraded its quality & trust. I suggest dont buy this machine instead put couple of thousands and buy Siemens & Bosch.  We buy Automatic washing machine to do wash clothes cleanly and properly. Below are Cons of IFB washing machine1> Machine wont wash the cloths properly. Uses very less water & most of the time clothes just gets little water which is not enough to wash. Yeah, I know front loading washing machine takes less water and saves water but what is the purpose when the water is not enough to clean the clothes.2> After wash, clothes have detergent smell and feel dry because during rinse it takes very little water. Most of the time detergent will be there in clothes even after wash. Also, the clothes are very dry. For this IFB always suggest same set of answers/suggestions like 1> Use liquid detergent 2> use softer, or 3> Water pressure is not enough or 4> Ground is not level, etc etc3> During AMC if any part goes bad (mostly it will be electronic main board ) for which they will  replace with another old main board which they might have got from another customer's machine which might have went bad. Over all they will change bad main board with another bad old main board.4> Taking AMC does not mean that if any part goes they will change it with a new part. What AMC company does is they will replace with an old board which they might have got from other customer's machine. Like this they will rotate bad items till the machine is under AMC.5> A minimum of 55litres water IFB washing machine should take to complete its wash. If it takes then clothes will be washes properly. If we ask IFB guy or store guy they never guarantee this and they will try to hide or avoid the customer.My conclusion is that we should AVOID buying IFB as we buy washing machines to wash out clothes properly. This machine and company is a headache."
1,28 June 2020,Very good,Don't buy this product. Such a worst I ever seen. I am getting frequent problem from this model. There is no good response from Amazon. I don't recommend to anyone.
5,28 June 2020,IFB Company & IFB washing machine is a headache. Don't Buy this IFB washing maciines,Very good product

2,22 June 2020,"a branded product, dont get the installation done as ...",Position of Washing machine changes for every wash. Full noisy and full vibration. And has only one inlet for detergent
2,22 June 2020,Wife is happy,The washing machine is ok but the installation engineer was rude and I wrote a detailed review about it but amazon declined to publish :)
1,21 June 2020,this product is not good,"I have been using it for sometime now, too many problems with the machine. No one supporting from service side. No customer care representative for last 2 Months now."
1,21 June 2020,Worst product,Installation not done by amazon or ifb...They have snatched my money.....
1,21 June 2020,Bad product and poor customer service,Have absolutely no idea what i like or dont about this product because it has bern over 10 days and I am still waiting for someone from IFB to call me to install the washing machine...absolutely deplorable customer service by IFB and amazon....!
5,19 June 2020,Amazon theif,Easy to use. Good build quality. Less noisier than the bosch 5.5 kg I had previously.
1,19 June 2020,10 days ans and waiting for product to be installed,poor product
5,18 June 2020,Indian brand! Great value for money!,IFB as a brand itself is sturdy and reliable. The WM is efficient and User friendly. Anyone can operate easily!! Product recommended n worth the value!!
1,17 June 2020,poor product,Don't buy this product from Amazon. I am weighting approx 30 days after delivery for installation. No support from Amazon as well as IFB. Last time the item was broken. That is the replaced one. Amazon customer care also not responding about the issue.
1,16 June 2020,Product Worth the Money! Easy to Use!!,"No one came from ifb company for installation of washing machine, although 8-9 times I have called them mailed them , ND they are not picking up my phn aslo this Amazon site is completely unusefull for electronic items becz no one come listen after item is been purchased ,"
5,15 June 2020,Do not buy it from Amazon,Happy with the purchase
1,14 June 2020,"a branded product, dont get the installation done as ...",But till now installation not done
5,14 June 2020,this product is not good,This is definitely a one stop choice when you want washing machine within best budget n best performance. Have been using since years without even a minor glitch in any way. Product is strong stable and high performance delivery.
1,13 June 2020,Technician visit too delay,"Not good, service is bad"
3,13 June 2020,Win win product,Team upper body slab was broken . Ifb executive promise to change it.
1,12 June 2020,Service,Worst machine I have took it 2 years agoo till now single wash is aslo not done properly many complaints raised but no solution.. please customers don't get tied with this BRAND name it is 💯 worst product .. some other machines which is in low cost is most better than this.My machine since 2 years rapidly shows error . Everything is fine alos then it is again shows error.. pls pls pls don't get frod by IFB.. THE WORST PRODUCT.
5,12 June 2020,Need to improve on packing so that item could not damaga,A very good product.
1,11 June 2020,Worst product,guy came for installation He has informed us that the machine is damaged and needs to be replaced.
1,08 June 2020,Good product,"I'm giving it one star because the machine was not installed by IFB, there was no response from them and the customer support number never get through.Poor coordination from Amazon side from the brand installation team if installation was not possible then they would have not delivered the product.It more looked like fetching the money and then keep the custom struggling. Also the replacement window is only for 1 week if installation is not only happening then how would a customer know that product has some problem. I had to call a local technician to install it and had to pay him separately. Poor customer service both from amazon and IFB."
4,08 June 2020,Received the Damage Machine,Good condition
4,05 June 2020,Amazon Customer,Good
