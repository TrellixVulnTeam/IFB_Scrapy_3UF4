3,21-Jul-20,A product worth purchasing!!,This is very high cost and not a good quality.not reached expectations.heavy vibrating during spinning position.
3,10-Jul-20,LG Washing Machine is a good choice,Money wise  after bought here we got some money difference than Amazon. There is more discount there.
5,08-Jul-20,Very high cost,"It’s very good product.Amazon will deliver this item, next day LG person will come for installation.Got Initial warranty of 2 years , later bought additional warranty of 3 yrs from LG person by paying five thousand eight hundred rupees."
1,07-Jul-20,Money wise gelot little less discount than others,"I have 5.2kg machine purchased around 8 yrs back. 6 months ago motor needed replacement. Was replaced promptly.Now display pcb not working and also control ckt pcb looks damaged.But LG is saying to get display pcb repaired from outside, as they no longer stock this spare.I am willing to pay for new PCBs , but they say now can't service them.What is the purpose of this practice.Should customer purchase new one for only one faulty part.Dear Customer, Your request has been registered [RNP200621044367]"

5,15-Aug-20,Excellent and Silent Machine,"After using machinh for 11 months, i am writing review. Very good machine. Earlier i was using LG semi auto machine for 15-16 years, which was also good. I gave that machine to a poor man, who is using that old machine in a good condition. That os why i bought LG brand this time too. EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE of my LG front load machine. THANKS TO LG"
1,13-Aug-20,Delivered faulty machine error code:DE,"Product is very very bad, please don't purchase any product from LG, delivery was delayed and installation no one had come, no response from LG and installation not happened, too much delay, worst service support by lg never purchase this product, not worth at all..I will never ever prefer lg product henceforth.."
2,11-Aug-20,"After using 11 months, saying it EXCELLANT",Product is very good but worst installation. Service/Demo guy is not even ready to move the machine and he dint gave a proper demo of the product. We had to figured out everything.
1,08-Aug-20,Worst product don't purchase it..,Pathetic Service. There is smell in cloths . LG people not able to resolve
5,07-Aug-20,Good Product but worst installation,Good Machine
1,05-Aug-20,Pathetic Performance,Too much vibration and informed customer care But there’s no response
4,04-Aug-20,Easy to use and powerful,I like this product due to time saver and less noise.
4,03-Aug-20,Must Report,I bought the product under Bajaj Finserv finanace for 2.75k per month for 12 months but they are taking a charge of 2.96k.Highly disappointed with the trust they have given in EMI.
4,31-Jul-20,Something special for everyone,The product is worthy and useful
1,31-Jul-20,Product is good but the emi they are giving is not trustable,"Hello,Please do not buy any electronics product from Amazon and especially for LG. I purchased a washing machine and it is been communicated by Amazon that demo request had been sent to LG. After 2 days of delivery, LG Engineer  called me for installation of AC even my product is washing machine. He said again you had to raise a request by calling LG customer care. on 29-Jul-2020, I received a call my LG Engineer from Kothrud and he said request is assigned to him as wrong address was entered by LG customer care.3) Today, I called amazon , raised a new request now once again after 6 days of delievery, still the issue exists :(Now, they are pointing finger on each other (LG-->Amazon) but problem still unresolved.Very bad delivery and communication by both LG and Amazon."
3,27-Jun-20,Excellent and Silent Machine,Noise level is good.
5,25-Jun-20,Delivered faulty machine error code:DE,Value for money
1,23-Jun-20,Noise when working,"Pathetic experience, delivered on June 1st and installation got automatically cancelled by the system, No one turned up for the installation till today. I just tried installing on own. The machined washed the clothes smoothly but spinning and draining is horrible with huge huge huge noise level and huge huge huge vibration. I am attaching the video. I hope and amazon will take necessary action and send the technician to support or return the product immediately."
5,19-Jun-20,Nice product,"Amazing, excellent. Happy to have this product"
5,16-Jun-20,Huge Noise with vibration. Hitting the wall. Whole family scared. Could not experience single wash,We are the first time user of a fully automatic machine. Seems to be a nice product with zero noise good and user friendly washing system. The weight of the machine is quite heavy. Earlier was looking for Bosch but the review I got for Bosch was not satisfactory interms of post sales services and expensive parts. The installation of the machine was very smooth by a perfect professional.
5,16-Jun-20,Best,Excellent
5,15-Jun-20,You are at the right place,i am fully satisfied. its working nice. 8kg is suitable for 4-5 people in a family.
5,14-Jun-20,A great work by Amazon,"Noise less product . Excellent one , go for it . Very less vibrations.  Hardly one can notice it"
5,14-Jun-20,worth purchasing for around 4-5 people,"Great product. That’s the best part of buying from Amazon. When you see more than 200+ reviews with 4.5 ratings along with descriptive  reviews One can confidently buy.After using the machine for 2 weeks, here is my review. The machine has charming aesthetics and works efficiently. The controls are simple, vibrations less and doesn’t scream  while spinning.Only issue I faced was post receiving the delivery. There was confusion on installation. LG had sent an sms with contact details  on the installation agent. The agent refused to come and had asked me to contact LG directly. Tried calling LG But in vain (due to the COVID) situation. Then after contacting Amazon for installation they sent me an android link for LG App and asked me to register there. Felt that process was tedious and confusing."
5,07-Jun-20,Value for money,"Great product,"
