5,11-Aug-20,Satisfied customer,Overall Good
1,06-Aug-20,Easy to Use,"I was excited to have this in my home but the return time mentioned as just 10 days is not enough coz I dont wash clothes on daily basis. I washed once oon the 5th day of getting this machine and then again on 12th day, at first wash I had stains on my clothes of grease and I thought that its just coz the machine is new , post that on my second wash there were stains again on different set of clothes. So now I sit here with almost 15000 wasted in a Spinning Tub which for me is of no use ."
1,04-Aug-20,as per Expectation,"Suffering with so many issues after 3 month, also whirlpool customer care people are not customer centric- simply feeling helpless. Not recommended to buy otherwise someone needs to be appointed to maintain this product only for full time."
5,01-Aug-20,Leaves Stain,Value for money .
2,01-Aug-20,Never buy again any whirlpool brand product,"after wash if you turn on the drain, all the water dont drain off. it makes a tough job for the dryer. the inlet pipe is also not good and not hard. it can easily break. there is no facility to fix the inlet to pipe firmly to a tap. A connector has to be used which is always not a firm one. In many washing machines the inlet pipe is very hard one and can be attached firmly giving no scope for wear and tear and leakages. The washing quality is also substandard."

1,26-Jun-20,Good service Amazon,"Had there been a negative rating I would have definitely gone for it just for the post sale service of whirlpool.Drier has stopped working In less than 6 months, continuosly calling whirlpool care for last 6 days and hearing 1 line only our technician will call in 2 hrs. I really wonder if their 2 hrs will evr come in 2020.They have shameless team of Telecallers who will say we are transfering my call to senior and after 1 hr of waiting on call another of their representative will pick call and will say same dialogue we are transfering your call and no1 will Ever bother for resolving the complaint.Complaint no.FAR20062080339"

1,16-Jun-20,Very good product üëç,Very sad that Whirlpool is not supporting in imstallation & demo of the product... I have bought this with a hope that there will be support from the manufacturer but very sorry that they r very adament n asking me to talk to Amazon only since bought online. VERY POOR SUPPORT. Want to return the item if installation and Demo is not provided.
1,15-Jun-20,no instruction manual inside the package,"While opening the product made video and checked that product is used because found scratch on wash cover and dry spot of water , this is really a bad experience even I heard frm lot of people that Amazon delivers used products but this felt that experience also ."
5,23-Jul-20,So for It is really working Good,"I have been using this washing machine since 10 months and the product is working well. Initially I had issues with the spin tub and got it replaced by calling Whirlpool support. Overall, product is good in this range and ideal for big families."

5,12-Jun-20,Damage item send by smazon,"Good product, size is bulky, so measure your space before purchasing."
5,11-Jun-20,I am happy,"I surely want all the other customers of amazon to know that my new washing machine already had water in the washing tub section. From where the hell water came in my new washing machine is a big question mark ##????###. Either it has been used by someone before or it has been repaired ,replaced and delivered to a new customer like me again. I am desperate to know it from the amazon authorities the reason for it . Hoping that there will be a clear picture rather than playing a blame game."
5,09-Jun-20,Good product,Product for affordable price.
5,08-Jun-20,Unexplained presence of water in washing tub of new washhing machine,Excellent product but too costly
5,08-Jun-20,Ultimate destination is Whirlpool.,Worth it buying... This isn't a washing machine it is a type of small laundry at ur home... You can wash so many clothes in this....worth buying this washing machine.
