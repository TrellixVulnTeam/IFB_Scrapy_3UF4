4,14-Aug-20,DO NOT buy LG products,Good
1,14-Aug-20,Value for money,"Amazon and LG both customer service is, useless  no one interested to help customer. I called LG customer care more than five times but the kind of answer we are getting is unacceptable. There is, no timeline as to when a mechanic will come and install the machine."
1,13-Aug-20,Better,No body has come up for installation
4,13-Aug-20,LG and Amazon customer care and service is of no help . Completely useless.,When I thought to buy this I reviewed a lot.for top load LG is so good and durable. But many people bought Samsung I think it's due to less cost than LG but LG had more guarantee time than LG both on moter and product but Samsung has less I think it's 4-5 year only.
5,13-Aug-20,No installation,"Bought this at Rs. 14,999 exclusive deal, worth the money. Noise free machine, calculates timing properly. So far so good. Tub cleaning functionality is great. Haven't tried modes other than 4 and 5. prewash + normal works perfect for me."
5,13-Aug-20,It's good,Excellent machine to my satisfactionWashes 15 to 20 clothes each cycle  with less soap better washAutomatic washes in 45 minutes timeRecommend this top loading LG unit

4,24-Jul-20,Best Purchase,Good
1,23-Jul-20,Tooo bad service by amazone.,"The washing machine came damaged, the motor is not working, and a complaint was lodged with LG.Unfortunately the complaint was lodged after 10 days of receipt of the machine as it was installed in a new apartment.LG sent a text message on 10th July 2020 stating a technician SAMEER DALVI would attend to the machine and replace the motor, but the same remains unattended after 14 days of receiving a BRAND NEW MACHINE.VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE & A BAD NAME FOR LG ELECTRONICS.Stay away from this company."
4,23-Jul-20,Good,"Liked the product, infact its a product for the homemaker and according to my homemaker... its an awesome item, easy to use, worth."
1,12-Aug-20,Amazing product,Okay
5,31-Jul-20,Amazing product,It is good product no more vibration & easy to use..
3,09-Aug-20,Amazing product,Didn't receive invoice of the product.
4,12-Aug-20,DO NOT buy LG products,"5 star for Delivery and Installation. Amazon delivered 2 days before schedule. Lg guy installed the washing machine same day, even in lockdown. Flipkart is not even accepting orders for my city.Prima facie the machine is looking fine. Will give detailed review on quality of wash, water usage etc after some usage."
1,11-Aug-20,LG Team,"Installtion of the product is still pending, after 2 days of purchase we got a call for installation, but the person who came only demonstrated the product and didn't do any installation.whereas it is clearly mentioned on this site that customers will be called for installation within 48 hours of purchase.pls look in to the matter and do the needful."
1,11-Aug-20,Good product by LG,Installation person not responding and taking long time for respond please don't believe LG installation
4,11-Aug-20,Installation is still pending from LG,Washing machine nice and value for money . But LG service waste . The representative came for installation and he really don't give value for customers . He don't have patience at all . He did not explains the programs first he don't know the programs . He did not wait for some time . He said After installing the inlet pipe his work is over. Don't send these people to the customers for the installation.
5,11-Aug-20,Free installation don't believe,Rating based on 2 months after purchase... LG Washing machine meet the expectation for me.
4,11-Aug-20,Nice product but product waste service.,Quality product
5,10-Aug-20,Good,"I'm using this machine from last 10 years. So far so good, used it every single day"

5,29-Jul-20,Washing Machine installer,Very good product. Received as committed by amazon. Moreover service personals from LG was available for installation within 1hr of delivery. Satisfied with amazon service
5,29-Jul-20,DEFECTIVE ITEM RECIEVED,Excellent value washing machine
1,29-Jul-20,Very satisfied product and process of delivery and installation,"Please don't buy this model, although the company claims it to be their latest model, it's a poor performer. My 12 years old LG fully automatic 6.5 kg top loading was much better. It's better to buy semi automatic rather than buying this model."
4,28-Jul-20,Good quality machine,"I brought this product on July .Writing review after 3 weeks of use .It is very good for old age people as it is very easy to operate .-> The Noise level is very low .-> there are more wash programs .-> the problem is it doe snot dry clothes up-to the  mark , even there will be lot of wet in clothes even after spinning the clothes .There is no Air dry option . it is only of tub clean .That is only the issue with the machine , all other is good ..I recommend this machine 4/5."
1,28-Jul-20,Please don't buy this model.,Worst product with in 3 days machine is not working
4,09-Aug-20,DO NOT buy LG products,It how much use water
5,08-Aug-20,Didn't receive invoice of the product.,Best quality no noise & easy to use best price for purchase
5,08-Aug-20,Water use,Washing is OK but some times extra drying is needed for large bed-sheets and thin blankets compared to the previous model in LG which was excellent and did not give trouble for 5.5 years. This one need to be observed as its just a month old but saves on the electricity as the energy rating is 5 star
5,08-Aug-20,Best quality no noise & easy to use best price for purchase,We haven't faced any problems yet after a month's use
5,08-Aug-20,Good washing machine,Lg superb
4,08-Aug-20,Good all-round machine,Good
5,07-Aug-20,Perfect,The machine is really good. I took 6.5 kg version. Noise level is minimal but there is some. Select the wash type as per the need or else there will be washing powder stains on the clothes even after wash.
5,07-Aug-20,Good,I am very satisfied with the product. Amazon delays installation.You guys can directly call the company get it installed immediately.
1,07-Aug-20,Nice washing machine. Worth money,Not working
5,17-Aug-20,Amazing product,"Brand: LG so far never disappoint us, we are using maximum LG appliance# This machine has inverter motor + 5 star rating  save elevtricity# Not measured but i must say this machine consume less water than semi automatic# No noise at all, buzzer willlet u know when work done# really easy to use# not sure if hard water will cause harm for machine, but we bought 1k hard water filter using at water inlet point, no harm in that# LG top brand in home appliances,  picked this machine over ifb, Samsung and bosch# 5 star for amzon for offer , on time delivery and demo"

1,16-Aug-20,LG Washing Machine review...,"The Machine has dent on left side, the machine is not easy to use for older people as there are multiple steps. I had haier machine which starts right away when you press start but this machine takes atleast 5-7 minutes to completely start and you have to be in front of it just in case it doesn't start or fails thats really uncomfortable. Also the dryer is not efficient when i compare with 10k rs Haier automatic machine."
5,15-Aug-20,Easy to use n works fine.,"It’s a great machine , easy to use and low noise level and is also inverter based model . It’s looks good and is absolute value for money . Researched many brands and switched from Samsung front load to a LG top load . Also great exchange and delivery service by amazon . Got it installed personally as did not have time to avail the free installation service ."

3,15-Jul-20,Amazing product,Machine is good but Water inlet pipe was not working. Bought new pipe from LG service person by paying extra
5,20-Jul-20,Amazing product,All in all it is gud bt only one things is there it is mentioned in question and answers category that it is 5 star product but in product it is not mentioned
5,11-Jul-20,DO NOT buy LG products,"I used LG front loading for 14 years and without a single repair. And now I recently bought this machine for my parents and am absolutely happy. Very convenient to operate, noiceless, efficient, long lasting life cycle. Fully recommend."
5,11-Jul-20,Wrong detailed,"I found the product is very nice, low noise and effectively washing. Delivery & installation was prompt..Value for money!"
1,11-Jul-20,Absolutely Great Machine,"Motor broke, after 10 days of use.  Stops operation on minimum load.  Extremely bad service of LG.  Almost no response on mutiple calls."
5,11-Jul-20,Good product! Value for money!!,"I found some scratches on the panel. However got two years warranty. Hence hope there won't be any issues.Installation was done by myself. Technician came twice for installation, that's really a good thing. And he has done his best service. Thanks for the support."
5,10-Jul-20,"Motor broke, after 10 days of use.",Value for money
2,09-Jul-20,Appears to be old. But excellent machine.,I have not received inv and warranty card that is inv.copy
5,09-Jul-20,Good one... You can go for it....,Nice product using this from 1 week.. working good. Lg is best1
3,08-Jul-20,Inv copy,Very nice looking good washing good product 👍
5,07-Jul-20,Lg is best always..,"Good product of reputed company, at reasonable price."
4,15-Jul-20,DO NOT buy LG products,Noise level is awesome and less user friendly some option not understand. Yes it is value for money.
1,15-Jul-20,Issue in water inlent pipe,It was mentioned that it is smart door lock. But the one I recieved isnt smart door lock. Feel cheated.
5,15-Jul-20,Good but not superb.,LG machine is good compare to whirlpool as my previous Whirlpool machine was last only 3 year.I am using this LG washing machine since Last year. Of course it is not high end machine but as we use it daily without any problem so I can recommend it for buy.
2,14-Jul-20,Cheated!,I have purchased product on march 2020 after 2 months it's stopped working. Complaint raised to lg service but still now problem not recitified. Very poor product service. I need a exchange.
5,14-Jul-20,Worth product,"I am using this machine for the last six weeks and I am happy with its performance. It is easy to use and noise level is ok. Only problem is that light clothes, nowadays most of them are light are not fully immersed in water. The nylon net as mentioned in manual could have prevented floating of clothes. Supply of the nylon net with the machine as an additional accessory would have helped."
5,13-Jul-20,Poor product service support,Very helpful and easy to use
4,13-Jul-20,A good washing machine,As per description Smart door mentioned actually it doesn't hv smart door..
1,13-Jul-20,Very good,Water leakage in the out let water pipe and reported the same to Amazon team but no response

2,18-Jul-20,Good Product to Buy,Seems the feature of the product are not at par and also observed machines delivered is defective from day 1
3,18-Jul-20,defective piece is deliverd to me,The technician checked  the product for installation the machine was not worked due to issues in board.
3,17-Jul-20,LG 6.5 kg washing machine feedback,"If you want features and looks, this machine is a perfect one in this price range. But for washing, I would not recommend it.Pros:-Light weight.-Very good after sales service by LG.-Machine can be used as a semiautomatic one to save water.-Power consumption is less.-Motor speed is good.Cons:-Washing is not at all good. I mean even small small stains are also not washed properly in it. Tried 2 washing powder for top loading machines. Will update after using Top loading washing liquid."
5,17-Jul-20,MACHINE WAS NOT PROPERLY  CHECKED BEFORE SENDING IT FOR DELIVERY,Very gud washing machine
5,17-Jul-20,Poor Washing Quality.,"Nice, value for money"
5,17-Jul-20,Very gud whashing machine,It is good product but I received with a big dent
1,16-Jul-20,Nice,Received a defected piece. Water was not coming in. Technician tried to fix it. But its not working.
4,07-Jul-20,Amazing product,child lock is not available.
1,07-Jul-20,DO NOT buy LG products,We bought this junk for 16000 rupees on June 16 seeing product ( LG )reviews and seller Cloudtail reviews. Product broke down in 15 days/2 weeks after 4 uses  !!! . A friend of mine who visited my place said the motor must have gone bad. He had the same experience. The motor is the heart of a washing machine. A washing machine is just a box with a rotating drum powered by the motor. I can't believe all this  !Now LG just has a whatsApp number with automated response. But they are useless.My humble suggestion - please avoid LG (zero after-sales service) and Cloudtail (looks like they are selling defective washing machines).
5,06-Jul-20,Good product. Value for money.,One problem in it .It use to so many water
4,06-Jul-20,Buy at your own risk,Nice product in this price value but  lg demo service is worst.

1,26-Jun-20,Damaged product,"Never purchase LG product. I have recieved a defective product. service is very bad. Customer Care do not respond. The machine is under breakdown within 10 months of purchase. The service engineer could not repair the same stating house electric, water , alignment problems whichmakes no sense. It is my honest advice that NEVER EVER PURCHASE LG PRODUCTS."
4,25-Jun-20,Service part very worst LG care,Nice
5,25-Jun-20,Defective faulty washing machine recieved from LG,"At Rs.16,000 , this is the best possible electronic product you can buy, it has never been this easier to wash clothes. No confusion or any flaws about it, just perfect."
1,04-Jul-20,DO NOT buy LG products,After one wash it gives a noise.. waste of money and time
3,04-Jul-20,Wrong info from seller,The dryer is worst as it does not dry the clothes well
1,04-Jul-20,Pathatic product,Any problem with your washing machine? Just connect it to the SmartThinQ app and know the problem. You can diagnose up to 86 errors........This description is completely wrong this model dose not connect to ThinkQ app
5,03-Jul-20,Ok,superb with best technology
3,03-Jul-20,SmartThinQ app not supported with this model,Not deep clean fake
4,03-Jul-20,Product is amazing buy it without any worries,Delivered but not installation n demo provided till date.. requesting Amazon to expedite the matter

3,02-Jul-20,Installation & demo not provided till date,Nice product using since a year but sometimes vibrates
5,01-Jul-20,Amazing,good
4,24-Jun-20,Amazing product,Very high water consumption. Our previous one was LG front-load and that fronload consumed qtr the quantity of water that the top load does. But it's very silent when at work. Can't hear it operate from 10 feet distance..
5,23-Jun-20,DO NOT buy LG products,good

5,07-Jun-20,Amazing product,Nice product
1,07-Jun-20,DO NOT buy LG products,The worst service. Never buy any LG product. Service people won't come even after calling so many times. Even they won't track whether it completed or not.
1,06-Jun-20,Value for money,"I received the defective product. So please careful before you use it. The magic filter which collects in the dust is not properly finished. So even if I buy a new Magic filter, I can not fit into it. I am trying to return the product. Amazon is not allowing. Amzon is saying go to LG customer care. LG Customer care does not have any option of the return the defective product."
1,05-Jun-20,Never buy any LG product,"Machine is delivered and it’s been 5 days no technician from LG has visited to install the same. This is inspite of AMAZON also chasing LG service twice. If this is the level of service and response times of LG at the time of installation, how can I trust them during the warranty period or otherwise. If LG does not turn up to install by the 7th day, I will be forced to RETURN THIS PRODUCT & take another brand. Would never recommend any LG product anymore. Buy at your own risk. Will update this review in a few days."
5,04-Jun-20,Defective Product,"The product is really good no noise, clean clothes, and look wise also good. LG as a brand has its own goodwill. The best product to buy in limited budget."
1,04-Jun-20,Extremely disappointed!,I brought this and the item is defective. The motor is poor and not spinning.Regret to have this product. :(
5,04-Jun-20,Amazing Machine,Product is goodBut don't buy onlineU face installation problem
2,04-Jun-20,Item is defective,"Worst service by LG. I tried to contact LG service person serveral times for the installation but nobody helped me. After 15 days of product delivery, none of the LG service person come to my place for the installation and they keep on telling we will reach you today. I lost my patience and installed my self."
5,03-Jun-20,Don't buy amazon installation process,"Am happy with the product, easy to use and perfect for a family of 3."
1,03-Jun-20,LG service experience,Installation not done in properly the guy came for installation don't have enough knowledge about the machine he don't know what is turbdrum he don't know about the all process or features of the machine and machine is making lots of noise while running on rinse and on spin cycle looks like not working properly
