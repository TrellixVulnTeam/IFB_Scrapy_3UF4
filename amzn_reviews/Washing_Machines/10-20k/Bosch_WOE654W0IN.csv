5,10-Jul-20,Bosch,Wonderful one
5,09-Jul-20,Amazon selling washing machine from unauthorised dealers / shops.,Putting this review after 4 months of use.-Enough for family of 4-5 people-Easy programmes (Bosch executive will explain all while installation)-Good built quality-Drum is of stainless steel and it doesn't tear of the clothes-Water and power consumption is not much-Better than LG and Videocon-Extended warranty is applicable if installed by Bosch Executive
2,02-Jul-20,Worthy product,"We purchased the WM last week, tried the product on Monday only and found that it is making too much noise. Not able to upload that video because of size restriction. Have been trying to reach out to the technician but he is not responding. Now, have raised a complain as well via customer care. A bit confuse now. If I don't get any assistance then would be returning the product by tomorrow."
5,28-Jun-20,Best Budget Washing Machine,Good to use
1,27-Jun-20,Making too much sound,Product not installed despite of multiple follow upsWorst customer service from BOSCH
1,22-Jun-20,I am happy to using this,"I was almost about to hit the place order button. But realised, this product is made in China."
4,17-Jun-20,Worst Service from BOSCH,Niceeeeee
5,14-Jun-20,Made in China,Good machine and no loud sound work properly.
3,13-Jun-20,Nicee product,"Bought this machine worked well for seven months, then rat bite damaged cables, factory installed rat guard is not effective. While the product is in warranty, the service does not cover rat bite and the service fee was Rs. 2000 (very expensive). Internal cable assembly was of poor quality, a small portion of cable damage needs replacement entire cable assembly, poor engineering."
5,08-Jun-20,Good,"good product, although took some follow_up time for installation, probably due to lockdown. bosch support is really good. Amazon delivery could have been better"
1,06-Jun-20,Bosch,"Posting a review after 1.8 year of machine usage. Machine stopped working after 1.8 years.Nearly 30 days have elapsed Bosch enginner visited place 3 times but could not rectify the default. If this is happening for a product under warranty, then what will happen for product after warranty.Don't buy this machine you will regret afterwards"
5,02-Jun-20,Amazon selling washing machine from unauthorised dealers / shops.,Super good product

4,01-Jun-20,Good one,Writing this review after 5 months of using Bosch washing machine. Easy to use and washes clothes well. Gentle sound of machine during various cycles. Easy to clean also. On the whole I am happy with this washing machine.
4,29-Jul-20,Bosch,So far so good i didn't have any complaints . We bought it one month back from then we were actually comfortable with it. Value for money.
3,29-Jul-20,Amazon selling washing machine from unauthorised dealers / shops.,Required more water. No drain pump. Nit easy to handal.
1,27-Jul-20,Worth buying,It's not starting.. faulty product
5,27-Jul-20,Basic model,It's a value for money products.Delivered in a manner without any scratches.Installation done by the technician within time frame.
4,22-Jul-20,Not switching on faulty product,"I am writing this review, after using the machine from last 3 days. Machine was delivered on sunday and today is Wednesday, till date no one contacted my for the installation.Extremely disappointed on installation part. I had no option but to install the  machine myself.Machine is good and easy to use. The only problem that i had noticed is the extremely poor quality of the magic filter. Bosch has to thinks about it.The country of origin of the machine is China."
5,22-Jul-20,Bosch is a Boss,Writing this review after using it for 6-7 month it's good product as compared to other companies .....I was gone through IFB as well but I read in review that at the time of installation they give stand & drum cleaner & said that without it warranty will be lapses but it is not with bosh very good product ..... thanks Amazon
5,19-Jul-20,Good Product,"We are using this product more than a year now.. I would say it’s the best you can get in this price range. very less noise, removes the stains (Normal), should appreciate the build quality and it’s very stylish (we bought grey).User friendly and a lot options.I searched a lot in Showroom as well as in online platforms during the time of purchase this is the best I found in my budget. People who look for a smart  and less noise machines please go for this . It’s German Engineering."
1,18-Jul-20,Very good product must buy it,"I ordered Bosch 6.5 Kg Fully-Automatic Top Loading Washing Machine (WOE654W0IN, White) on 13th July 2020. The product was delivered next day (i.e. on 14th July 2020). An installation and demo request was raised with Bosch India on 15th July 2020. Bosch Installation Engineer came on July 18th 2020. He started the demo, but the unit was not consuming water at all. No issues with Water Pressure as the washing machine is placed on first floor and water tank is on 3rd floor. After several attempts and discussions with his service department colleagues, he declared it’s a defective piece.I am surprised and shocked, Bosch and Amazon, two world's best companies have delivered me a defective washing machine.BTW excerpt from the User Manual: ""To meet the high quality demands required by Bosch, every washing machine that leaves our factory is carefully checked to ensure that it functions correctly and is in perfect condition. Your appliance has been thoroughly tested before leaving the factory""I have given one start for delivering the unit next dayI will ask Amazon to replace the unit."
5,18-Jul-20,Best Machine,Awesome experience
5,11-Jul-20,Bosch and Amazon delivered me defective product,"I believe in Bosch products a lot. They are value for money, stylish, durable and great service too. Washing machine is quite sleek and intelligent washing"

5,08-Aug-20,Good product,Excellent product.....very friendly to use
5,06-Aug-20,The installation experience is very bad,Purchased this in March 2020 with exchange for my semiautomatic machine. Till now no issues. Easy to use and compact.
5,03-Aug-20,Zabardast ...product,The machine is compact and fit into the narrow space available to me easily. Controls and commands are easy to use. Cleans well.
1,01-Aug-20,Value For Money,"Unable to file complaint and need to get attention for the E3 error while starting the washing machine. No one picking up the toll free number. Submitted the form reponse for complaint. But no answer and no reply about the support. It is not even 6 months passed ,I had purchased this product"
2,01-Aug-20,Compact and effective,Writing this review after 2 years of usage.Pros- Machine had no mechanical issues and washes decently. Customer Services are fine.Cons-Electronics - Time and again issue of Top cover opening and E3 errors. Had to call technician 3-4 times and just now again 5th time when it’s warranty of 2 years got over. Service charges Rs800 for the same issue it’s causing again.Rat mesh is of plastic and cheap quality.Technicians are below average and could not solve the problem. Not Happy with Bosch Washing machine and Technician’s. Hope Boasch team is listening.Thanks to Amazon for prompt and timely delivery.
