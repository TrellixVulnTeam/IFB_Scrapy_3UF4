5,20-Jun-20,not very happy,"Easy to use, options not much complicated..But due to lockdown no response from installation team, so done installation by self..."
1,16-Jun-20,Good and recommended,Purchased this LG washing machine but no news of installation yet. LG customer support is closed too when tried calling there. Amazon in the past has automatically scheduled the installation. Its been 4 days since the delivery and no news yet
4,15-Jun-20,Trusted brand and value for money..,"After 4 month, it stopped working."
1,12-Jun-20,Installation did not happen yet,Brand service people are worseNo one even came to do the demo

3,13-Jul-20,not very happy,I called many times for installation and demo.. Individual assured me to make it today.. But now he is denying.. And not attending my call
1,11-Jul-20,Nice,Really bad installation experience. Pathetic after sales LG support
5,08-Jul-20,All About installation and demo,"Very nice, buy it without any hesitation"
1,07-Jul-20,Bad installation and after sales,"I have 5.2kg machine purchased around 8 yrs back. 6 months ago motor needed replacement. Was replaced promptly.Now display pcb not working and also control ckt pcb looks damaged.But LG is saying to get display pcb repaired from outside, as they no longer stock this spare.I am willing to pay for new PCBs , but they say now can't service them.What is the purpose of this practice.Should customer purchase new one for only one faulty part.Dear Customer, Your request has been registered [RNP200621044367]"
4,05-Jul-20,"Noiseless,sturdy and intelligent",Very good productBut some vibrations issue
5,04-Jul-20,Unethical service practice,Go for it.  LG is always the best for washing machines.
5,29-Jun-20,Good product,"Nearly three weeks over, so far no issue"
5,25-Jun-20,Great washing Machine,I brought this for my parents specially for my mom. Even though she can't read English she is able use this without any effort. I am using lot of LG products from so long they are great..
5,24-Jun-20,I like it,Good product
5,16-Aug-20,Very good washing machine and Super washing quality.,LG washing machines are one of the best in business. This got the same direct drive motor and inverter technology as higher priced and featured varients. Superb price as well
5,14-Aug-20,not very happy,"I will try to give a detailed review of this product. Please mark my review as ""Helpful"" if it helps you so that it will help others too.Review date: 14/08/2020Delivery:The delivery guy was patient enough for the package to get sanitized below our home. He was wearing a mask and he promptly brought it to our home and kept it where we asked him to keep. No fuss.Packaging:I have attached the packaging pictures. I was delighted to see that this product was manufactured in India and that too just a month before the delivery. The packaging was great and because of that, there were no dents or scratches during transport.Installation:Some comments have mentioned that installation didn't happen on time. We promptly called up LG helpline number from the next day of delivery (mentioned on the packaging). Installation person wore a mask and had plastic covers on his feet. Installation was smooth, it got done in less than an hour. The installation guy also gave us a crisp demo regarding all the other functions of the machine. He did not ask us to take any accessories. There are 4 large screws behind the machine which MUST BE removed during installation. These are there for supporting the drum during transport but they are meant to be removed before using the machine, else machine will make a lot of noise during operation and also it can damage the machine. A spanner is provided to remove them. Keep the spanner and the large screws safe, they would be needed in case the machine needs to be moved to another home. I would advise to install the machine directly on the floor and not on a stand for minimum vibrations during use. The box DID NOT contain the anti-rat mesh, but it did contain the screws for the same. However, on the box, under accessories it clearly said that this unit contains an anti-rat cover. For quick installation, DO NOT follow up with Amazon, contact LG helpline directly.Performance:LG is an amazing brand for washing machines and this front-load machine is fantastic. I have used top load machines in the past, and these front load machines work in a completely different manner. The tumble wash gives a superior quality wash. Use of water is really less, which results in much less water wastage. The 6D motion offered at this price point is best in class. Our machine is installed in the kitchen, and it hardly makes any noise even while spinning at 1000 rpm. This is because of Direct Drive Technology, again best in class at this price point. I have attached the spin video. The clothes get washed properly, but not roughly. To get best performance, do not mix up all clothes together, but make batches of similar clothes and keep the setting and temperature as per the type of load. I have washed even soiled handkerchiefs in the intensive 60 mode and they have come out totally clean in an hour. Remember, it is a 6Kg machine, even if you think there is space for more clothes, do not overload it. For tumble wash to work best, it is good to keep a little space free. Till now I have not experienced any soap leftover in the clothes, hence it is rinsing well. Standard mix setting with full load can take around 1.5 hours to finish. If Pre-wash is required, it can add 15 minutes. Put detergent in the detergent tray and not directly on the clothes.Competition:Among reputed brands, this model has competition from IFB, Bosch and Samsung machines of all 6Kgs each. First of all, none of them use Direct Drive technology in this class. IFB and Bosch machines of this range do not have display LEDs, hence you will not be able to see how much time will a wash take and how much time is left. For me, that was a dealbreaker. Also, IFB gives around 4 years comprehensive warranty and 10 years Spare Parts Support. LG gives 2 years of comprehensive warranty but 10 years warranty on motor which is the most expensive part. My choice was between Samsung and LG. Samsung has a display LED, but is not a proper display like LG, it has limitations. Also, Samsung 6Kg machine of this range did not have either tub clean option or smart diagnosis, they had these options in the higher range. LG has these options in this machine. LG did cost me around Rs. 2000 more, but thinking about a long term perspective of 7/10 years, it was not a deal breaker for me. Also, I personally think LG is trustworthy for washing machines. Hence, I believe LG is better than these other brands in this particular range.Advantages:Direct Drive technology will ensure minimum noise and vibration during spin.Much better quality wash and care of clothes compared to top load machine.Very less water consumption.Fits well even in closed spaces because it needs to be opened from front, not top.Brand LG is superb for washing machines.Inbuilt heater is great for wash and for treating allergents. Top load machines will have inbuilt heater only at higher price points.Many settings and choices to get that perfect wash depending on the type of clothes.Disadvantages:Costlier than top load machines.Need to use detergent for front load machines which tend to be little bit costlier than top load machines.Comparatively little bit of inconvenience for bending to put and remove clothes from the front of the machine.Comparatively takes around 30 to 40 minutes more time than top load machines in the general mode.Conclusion:I am giving it a 5 star rating. If the above advantages weigh more for you than the disadvantages, you can safely select this machine. I would call it best in class.Again, please mark my review as ""Helpful"" if it helped you so that it will help others too."

1,24-Jul-20,The service abs product sucks,"The product is good but the installation and service agents are hopeless, useless and extortionist.  The worst words in English dictionary can be given to the authorized agent of LG Shafa & Co.  They also misinform the customer.  So buy machines whose authorized dealers are customer friendly.  Installation happened after 5 reminders"
