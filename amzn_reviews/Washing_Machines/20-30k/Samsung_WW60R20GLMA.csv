5.0,15 August 2020,My first online purchase of 50Kg applicances,Very nice tqq Amazon for fast delivery
5.0,14 August 2020,Do not buy from Amazon if you do not know how to install yourself,"Well, I bought a washing machine for Rs 21990 during prime day sale, 6-7 Aug 2020. After a lot of comparisons, I went for a Samsung front load 6kg washing machine. In fact, this is my first washing machine. I choose front-load rather than top load. Bcz- it's much better than the top load in many ways.Delivery: Delivered on time but the delivery persons were not ready to deliver a parcel on the 1st floor and expecting tips. I helped them to lift the washing machine on the first floor.  Overall, the experience was not good. Amazon, plz take a look at these issues.Installation: It was done on the same day of the delivery. I called the Samsung customer support and they arranged a demo & installation for me. The service engineer was a very knowledgable person. Explained all features such as how to use, clean, and maintain the machine. I will give 5 stars for the service.Pros:1. Best in this price range,2.3-year comprehensive warranty, and a 10-year warranty for the motor3. Service is good4. Easy to use5. Consumes less water for wash6. The Wash quality is quite good.Cons:1. Poor delivery experience from amazon2. Inlet pipe length is short (1Meter)3. side thickness seems not as good as the front."
4.0,14 August 2020,Best washing Machine,"Sleek design, silent motor and very good customer support. Due to lockdown I got text messages that installation couldn't complete soon. I requested then on whatsapp and within hour their man came and installed it. No cost at all."
1.0,14 August 2020,Best service-brand value and warrenty. Go for it.,Absolute pathetic service from amazon. Faulty product delivered. Not working during installation. Samsung technicians  advised to get it replaced. Amazon refusing the same and wants to send their own technician who are delaying the visit citing rains as a reason. All they are trying to do is exhaust the replacement window. Shame on Amazon. Will refrain from using amazon for expensive items. Pathetic
5.0,14 August 2020,Very good product from Samsung,Really satisfied with the Samsung...
5.0,13 August 2020,Faulty product,"Thank you for Amazon for delivering to remote area,  Value for money and working super. Mindly go for it.. working smoothly with less sound"
5.0,13 August 2020,Amazing,"As our first washing machine, it has been a very good experience. It is easy to use, and very quiet."
5.0,13 August 2020,working smoothly with less sound,"First I would like to thanks Amazon gave me the very good product. Coming to watching machine Samsung products are always good. The quality, performance and wash everything is very good. I am very happy with this. Thank you."
1.0,12 August 2020,Great product.,"Worst staff from samsung for installation not able to do small things, and he is trying to defend himself once he understands he is wrong, he started behaving politelyWORST STAFF OF SAMSUNG IN MY LOCATION"
3.0,12 August 2020,Very good product,"Good product but... the mechanic who came to install is worst kind of person, his behaviour with customer pulls back company reputation such persons should not be kept in the service."
5.0,4 July 2020,My first online purchase of 50Kg applicances,Value for money.  Easy to use.
4.0,3 July 2020,Do not buy from Amazon if you do not know how to install yourself,Very practical machine
4.0,2 July 2020,Awsome and trustworthy product,Product is excellent except both hose pipes are small.
5.0,2 July 2020,Practical,"About the product:The product is very goodIt is not noisy like other washing machinesWashing options are good. You can wash it in hot water also (there’s an option in the machine). During this scary time of coronavirus, it is very useful.It’s been a year I’m using this product and so far, so good.I bought the washing machine last year around June from Amazon and the delivery is also turned out to be good. This is the first time I’m buying a big home appliance online and that was the best decision I’ve ever taken. As others reviewed, I didn’t face anything bad during delivery or installation. Amazon delivery was also quite good.About Installation:I read all the reviews before buying and lots of people mentioned about the bad installation experience. So, I didn’t wait for the installation guy to call me. The next day, after the machine got delivered, I directly contacted the Samsung service and fixed an appointment. A very well-mannered engineer came and he fixed everything. First, he came to my house and said I need a little longer pipe. Next day he again came with the extra tubes and the stand which I've asked for. I paid for the stand and pipe (he didn't compel me to buy anything from him). It wasn’t that difficult to get an appointment also. He came the next day itself, after I called, and fixed everything for free.I’m so happy with the product and it looks so stylish.Pros*Works well*Cleans nicely/drier is also good*No loud noise*10 year waranty on the motor*3 year waranty on the whole machine*Amazon delivery is amazing*Samsung installation is also good*Heating water facility*looks cute*Easy to useCons*Washing takes little time (that's common with all front load machines)*Washing options could have been more"

1.0,25 June 2020,Nice product,totally useless.  installation service is just for name. Samsung is totally irresponsible  for installation. What to do with the machine without Installation ?

5.0,19 June 2020,Do not buy from Amazon if you do not know how to install yourself,"Good product, very low noise while soaking at 1000rpm as well. Reviewed many machines but selected this one and very much satisfied."
5.0,17 June 2020,Great product at least on the papers,NIce
5.0,10 June 2020,Good product in the similar price range,"Good job by Amazon, the product got delivered on time. The installation was done on the same day by Samsung, they didn't try to sell anything extra to me.Coming on the machine, I got the 6 kg 5 star variant of the machine. The machine comes with 3 years complete warranty and 10 years on motor as you can see in the attached photograph, don't know why amazon has put the wrong warranty information here.The performance is good, and there isn't any noise while it's operational. I would suggest to go for 6.5 kg ecobubble wash or the higher variant, if your budget allows. This is the best in this budget."
5.0,6 June 2020,Super,I purchased but after three month installation not done very bad experience
3.0,4 June 2020,Good performance,"Product delivery and installation happened perfectly on time. Though I loved the product, it had issues with the water drainage and the motor. Had to return the product. Waiting for the refund.No issues with the delivery or installation. If the product was functioning properly, would have given a 5 star rating to it.I would say, go for it.. if you notice any flaws, return it. If no flaws, trust me, it is worth every penny."
5.0,3 June 2020,Panic condition after buy this,Good
5.0,1 June 2020,Great product but turned out with manufacturing defects!,"I got the 7kg version of this, its a simple yet great product. the one thing i like the most is the quick wash which can be modified to only 10 minutes. n consumes less water. I have a lg one which is a nightmare to use with its 30 minutes ""quick wash"", door closed for very long time etc. This on the other hand is simple.Installed by myself watching youtube videos, the pipe they give doesnt have the tap connector so that has be bought from hardware store or order from amazon. be sure to place it in even surface using a leveler. be sure to remove the 3 shipping bolts at the back otherwise using the machine with shipping bolts still attached will cause  damage to the drums and shake the machine while spinning.Rest easy to use, maintain. happy with the product."

4.0,7 August 2020,"Amazon and Samsung ""GREAT SERVICE""","Writing review after 6 months of use , No issues so far. water outlet length is small but overall satisfied with the performance. Tested  heavy cloths for starting 10 days and happy to see the performance. 20 min mode for baby cloths/daily cloths is very good. Samsung guy came on time and installed. He did not share much info on specifications. Front load @ 20k  with exchange of old LG front load look satisfactory to me."

1.0,5 August 2020,Except drum cleaner...it is good,The washing machine is faulty. Stops withing few mins after starting. 2 visits from the technician and still not fixed. Pathetic response from Samsung Customer Care. Do not waste your TIME and Money on this piece of JUNK!
5.0,2 August 2020,Good,"People would suggest you so many brands but you need to remember your requirement and budget. For a single person or two, 6 kg is enough and price is decent. Very easy to use, nothing fancy. 5 star performance. Samsung did an excellent job!"
5.0,2 August 2020,DO NOT BUY! Problem within 1 month of buying,Service was excellent and the engineer was very courteous and well trained.Would surely recommend this product for the price n service.
5.0,30 July 2020,Delivered within a day and installation is done in less than 3 hours,"After 20 days use writing the review. From Samsung the washing machine is superb. Machine is working smoothly and silently. Samsung is the best brand. Washing quality is very good with liquid detergent. I am using liquid detergent.  Installing person installed without any cost and he didn't force to sell some items like stand and cover. I am using the machine without stand because of my floor is unbalanced.  Service person also suggested use the machine without stand, if you use the stand machine vibrating too much... without stand no vibration,  no sound.  Overall the machine is superb for 4members family. I really recommend the Washing machine if your budget 23000/-.... If you spend 27000/- you should buy 6.5kg eco bubble technology machine..."
1.0,29 July 2020,Excellent Product n Servicw,Installation person did not explain anything. Was totally irresponsible.
5.0,29 July 2020,Nice washing machine....,"very good product by SAMSUNG,service is so good ,but Amazon service person is third class"
